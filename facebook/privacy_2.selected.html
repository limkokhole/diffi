For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot or reshare that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality experiences such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/241256606347754?ref=dp">Facebook Spaces</a>. Also, when you comment on someone else&apos;s post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person&apos;s content, and that person can change the audience later. <br><br> People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/181495968648557?ref=dp">report the content</a>. </div></div><div class="_xpp"><div class="_xpq"></div><div class="_xpr"><div class="_5s0w" id="u_0_t">Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</div> People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on our Products, including whether you are currently active on <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F906123729538696%3Fref%3Ddp&amp;h=AT2xpOUzV6VltTaR9JyWUK-5MpijVkW5N7ypt03Mw_iEBGPW03qftstOxUVhC0n9jOwAaExaotoboohIm935HYnsosK8CBxnF3B1zRh4yRC7Hw_I3dd6na-RaIzwKc5Ll1yiQ1kWQdCI8g" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-lynx-mode="hover">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/149081061827062?ref=dp">Messenger</a> or Facebook, or when you last used our Products. </div></div><div class="_xpp"><div class="_xpq"></div><div class="_xpr"><div class="_5s0w" id="u_0_u">Apps, websites and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</div> When you choose to use third-party apps, websites or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/203805466323736?ref=dp">public profile</a> on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps and websites that you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites that you use will not be able to receive any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one. <br><br> Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have access to all information that you choose to share with them, including information that your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you. <br><br><i>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers&apos; data access even further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers&apos; access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven&apos;t used their app in three months, and we are changing login, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.</i></div></div><div class="_xpp"><div class="_xpq"></div><div class="_xpr"><div class="_5s0w" id="u_0_v">New owner.</div> If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner. </div></div><br><div class="_5s0w">Sharing with third-party partners</div><a href="#" id="sharing-partner-information" role="button"></a> We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world.

For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser. </div></div><div class="_xpp"><div class="_xpq"></div><div class="_xpr"><div class="_5s0w" id="u_0_y">Measurement partners.</div> We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners. </div></div><div class="_xpp"><div class="_xpq"></div><div class="_xpr"><div class="_5s0w" id="u_0_z">Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</div> When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public information and other information that you share with them, as well as the information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact details. </div></div><div class="_xpp"><div class="_xpq"></div><div class="_xpr"><div class="_5s0w" id="u_0_10">Vendors and service providers.</div> We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services, analysing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys. </div></div><div class="_xpp"><div class="_xpq"></div><div class="_xpr"><div class="_5s0w" id="u_0_11">Researchers and academics.</div> We also provide information and content to research partners and <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fresearch.fb.com%2Fprograms%2F&amp;h=AT3BHGMHm6Y6Gshj9vj4MxnCMoeIV3aRZ3LIadq5QxOdjeM1MIjqnjSY77gi_CsfOoADdOvaf83_bVESOomy26kwc13M95MKqClOQLZvpSdK5r_AYKbWVYjYM0YbnA7VfmxLkxCqiASyOw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-lynx-mode="hover">academics</a> to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that supports our business or mission and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and well-being. </div></div><div class="_xpp"><div class="_xpq"></div><div class="_xpr"><div class="_5s0w" id="u_0_12">Law enforcement or legal requests.</div> We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in the circumstances outlined <a href="#legal-requests-prevent-harm">below</a>. </div></div> Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or others share with third-party partners in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings">Facebook settings</a> and <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Faccounts%2Fprivacy_and_security%2F&amp;h=AT1HdAPVpwi-dmUFTjYmlNdrIwyezd8mlNK9obpnBDX1OuMvA3njBVl-FXUt_5QfFwrzk_0UuBc4pV7_DHhokPEekhwui5WqY4gnYzgEiSgaQdl-5cePFMRGwYnDDN4I2gjX_-v7ai4ZhA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-lynx-mode="hover">Instagram settings</a>. </div><div class="_3x93 _1-qu _52ii" id="u_0_13"><div class="_t3o" id="u_0_14"><a href="#" role="button"><div class="_17l6 _1-xl _17la"></div><div class="_t3q">Return to top</div></a></div><h3 class="_3x94 _52io"> How do the Facebook Companies work together? </h3> Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678?ref=dp">Facebook Companies</a> (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=dp">Facebook Company Products</a> that you use. We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their Terms and Policies. For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram or Messenger.
