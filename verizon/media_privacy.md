<li>**About Verizon Media**
<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>
Verizon Media, previously known as Oath, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of [Verizon](https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/privacy-policy-summary). We serve our consumers, partners, advertisers and talent through our portfolio of digital platforms, products and services offered under our AOL, Yahoo and other [brands](https://www.verizonmedia.com/our-brands).
</li>
<li>
We provide control tools to help you manage your experience with us. If you have an existing Yahoo or AOL account, you will need to agree to this Privacy Policy. If you have not yet agreed to this Privacy Policy, the [legacy Yahoo Privacy Policy](https://policies.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/index.htm?redirect=no) or [legacy Oath Privacy Policy (for AOL)](http://privacy.aol.com/legacy) still apply to your account. For Verizon Media products or services that are accessed without signing in to an account, this Privacy Policy applies to those products and services as of May 25, 2018. If you are creating a new account, the terms below apply starting today.
</li>

This policy applies to Verizon Media [brands](https://www.verizonmedia.com/our-brands), websites, apps, advertising services, products, services or technologies (we’ll collectively refer to these as “Services”). Additional privacy practices for certain Services can be found in [ Details for Specific Products and Services](/policies/us/en/verizonmedia/privacy/index.html#1).
