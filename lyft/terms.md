# Lyft Terms of Service

Last Updated: November 27, 2019


                    These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement (the “Agreement”)
                    between you and Lyft, Inc., its parents, subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates,
                    officers and directors (collectively, “Lyft,” “we,” “us” or “our”) governing your use
                    of the Lyft application, website, and technology platform (collectively, the “Lyft
                    Platform”).
                


                    Please be advised: This Agreement contains provisions that govern how claims between
                    you and Lyft can be brought
                    ([see Section 17 below](#tos-dispute-resolution-and-arbitration-agreement)).
                    These provisions will, with limited exception, require you to submit claims you
                    have against Lyft to binding and final arbitration on an individual basis, not as a
                    plaintiff or class member in any class, group or representative action or
                    proceeding. As a Driver or Driver applicant, you have an opportunity to opt out of
                    arbitration with respect to certain claims as provided in Section 17.
                


                    By entering into this Agreement, and/or by using or accessing the Lyft Platform
                    you expressly acknowledge that you understand this Agreement (including the dispute
                    resolution and arbitration provisions in Section 17) and accept all of its terms.
                    If you do not agree to be bound by the terms and
                    conditions of this Agreement, you may not use or access the Lyft Platform or any of
                    the services provided through the Lyft Platform. If you use the Lyft Platform
                    in another country, you agree to be subject to Lyft's terms of service for that country.
                

## The Lyft Platform


                    The Lyft Platform provides a marketplace where persons who seek transportation to
                    certain destinations (“Riders”) can be matched with transportation options to such
                    destinations. One option for Riders is to request a ride from rideshare drivers who
                    are driving to or through those destinations (“Drivers”). Drivers and Riders are
                    collectively referred to herein as “Users,” and the driving services provided by
                    Drivers to Riders shall be referred to herein as "Rideshare Services." As a User,
                    you authorize Lyft to match you with a Driver or Rider based on factors such as
                    your location, the estimated time to pickup, your destination, user preferences, and
                    platform efficiency, and to cancel an existing match and rematch based on the same
                    considerations. Any decision by a User to offer or accept Rideshare Services is a
                    decision made in such User’s sole discretion. Each Rideshare Service provided by a
                    Driver to a Rider shall constitute a separate agreement between such persons.
                


                    In certain markets, Riders may have the option to rent bikes or scooters through the
                    Lyft Platform to ride to their destination. In some markets these bikes and scooters
                    are owned by Lyft. In other markets Lyft operates a bike-share or scooter-share
                    program on behalf of third parties. In either case, your rental and use of bikes and
                    scooters through the Lyft Platform is subject to additional agreements between you and
                    Lyft and third parties as applicable to the particular market ("Supplemental Agreements").
                    Please review any applicable Supplemental Agreements carefully. If
                    you do not agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of a supplemental agreement,
                    you may not rent or use the bikes or scooters in such market. In the event of
                    any conflict between this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any Supplemental
                    Agreement, the terms of this agreement shall control.
                    

## Modification to the Agreement


                    Lyft reserves the right to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such
                    modifications shall be binding on you only upon your acceptance of the modified
                    Agreement. Lyft reserves the right to modify any information on pages referenced in
                    the hyperlinks from this Agreement from time to time, and such modifications shall
                    become effective upon posting. Continued use of the Lyft Platform or Rideshare Services
                    after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. Unless material
                    changes are made to the arbitration provisions herein, you agree that modification
                    of this Agreement does not create a renewed opportunity to opt out of arbitration
                    (if applicable).
                

## Eligibility


                    The Lyft Platform may only be used by individuals who have the right and
                    authority to enter into this Agreement, are fully able and competent to satisfy
                    the terms, conditions, and obligations herein. The Lyft Platform is not
                    available to Users who have had their User account temporarily or permanently
                    deactivated. You may not allow other persons to use your User account, and you
                    agree that you are the sole authorized user of your account. To use the Lyft
                    Platform, each User shall create a User account. Each person may only create
                    one User account, and Lyft reserves the right to deactivate any additional or
                    duplicate accounts.
                


                    By becoming a User, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years
                    old.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are the parent or legal guardian of
                    a 16 or 17-year old minor you may create a Lyft account for such minor to use
                    the Lyft Platform subject to the following requirements and restrictions: (a)
                    you ensure that the minor’s use of the Lyft Platform is limited solely to
                    accessing and using bike-share or scooter-share services where expressly
                    permitted under the Supplemental Agreement applicable to such services, (b) you
                    ensure that the minor’s use of the Lyft Platform and applicable bike-share or
                    scooter-share services is done in compliance and acknowledgement of all
                    applicable safety instructions and warnings in this Agreement, any applicable
                    Supplemental Agreements, and the Lyft App, (c) you ensure that the minor does
                    not request or accept any Rideshare Services unless accompanied by you or an
                    authorized guardian, and (d) you expressly guarantee the minor’s acceptance of
                    the terms of this Agreement. You will be responsible for any breach of the above
                    representations, warranties and/or this Agreement, and/or any attempt of the
                    minor to disaffirm this Agreement. Furthermore, you hereby represent that you
                    are fully authorized to execute this Agreement on behalf of yourself and all
                    other parents or legal guardians of the minor rider.
                


                    By creating a Lyft account for such minor, you hereby give permission and consent to
                    the Agreement on the minor’s behalf, and you shall assume any and all responsibility
                    and liability for the minor's use of the Lyft Platform as provided by the terms of this
                    Agreement and any applicable Supplemental Agreements. You will be responsible for any
                    breach of the above representations, warranties and/or this Agreement, and/or any
                    attempt of the minor to disaffirm this Agreement. Furthermore, you hereby represent
                    that you are fully authorized to execute this Agreement on behalf of yourself and
                    all other parents or legal guardians of the minor rider.
                

## Charges


                    As a rider, you understand that request or use of Rideshare Services may result
                    in  charges to you (“Charges”). Charges related to bikes and scooters are
                    addressed in  the applicable Supplemental Agreement. Charges for Rideshare
                    Services include Fares  and other applicable fees, tolls, surcharges, and taxes
                    as set forth on your market’s Lyft Cities page ([www.lyft.com/cities](https://www.lyft.com/cities)), plus any tips to
                    the  Driver that you elect to pay. Lyft has the authority and reserves the right
                    to  determine and modify pricing by posting applicable pricing terms to your
                    market’s  Lyft Cities page or quoting you a price for a specific ride at the
                    time you make a  request. Pricing may vary based on the type of service you
                    request (e.g., shared,  economy, extra seats, luxury) as described on your
                    market’s Lyft Cities page. You are  responsible for reviewing the applicable
                    Lyft Cities page or price quote within the  Lyft app and shall be responsible
                    for all Charges incurred under your User account  regardless of your awareness
                    of such Charges or the amounts thereof.
                


                    Fares. There are two types of fares, variable and quoted.
                

<li>
**Variable Fares**. Variable fares consist of a base charge and
                        incremental charges based on the duration and distance of your ride. For
                        particularly short rides, minimum fares may apply. Please note that we use GPS
                        data from your Driver’s phone to calculate the distance traveled on your ride.
                        We cannot guarantee the availability or accuracy of GPS data. If we lose signal
                        we will calculate time and distance using available data from your ride.
                    </li>
<li>
**Quoted Fares**. In some cases Lyft may quote you a Fare at the
                        time of your request. The quote is subject to change until the ride request is
                        confirmed. If during your ride you change your destination, make multiple
                        stops, or attempt to abuse the Lyft Platform, we may cancel the fare quote and
                        charge you a variable fare based on the time and distance of your ride. Lyft
                        does not guarantee that the quoted fare price will be equal to a variable fare
                        for the same ride. Quoted Fares may include the Fees and Other Charges below,
                        as applicable.
                    </li>


                    Fees and Other Charges.
                

<li>
**Service Fee**. You may be charged a “Service Fee” for each ride
                        as set forth on the applicable Lyft Cities page.
                    </li>
<li>
**Prime Time**. At times of high demand for Rideshare Services
                        ("Prime Time”) you acknowledge that Charges may increase substantially. For all
                        rides with a variable fare, we will use reasonable efforts to inform you of any Prime
                        Time multipliers in effect at the time of your request. For quoted fares we may
                        factor in the Prime Time multiplier into the quoted price of the ride.
                    </li>
<li>
**Cancellation Fee**. After requesting a ride you may cancel it
                        through the app, but note that in certain cases a cancellation fee may apply.
                        You may also be charged if you fail to show up after requesting a ride. Please
                        check out our Help Center to learn more about
                        <a href="https://help.lyft.com/hc/articles/115012922687-Cancellation-policy-for-passengers">
                        Lyft’s cancellation policy</a>, including applicable fees.
                    </li>
<li>
**Damage Fee**. If a Driver reports that you have materially
                        damaged the Driver's vehicle, you agree to pay a “Damage Fee” of up to $250
                        depending on the extent of the damage (as determined by Lyft in its sole
                        discretion), towards vehicle repair or cleaning. Lyft reserves the right (but
                        is not obligated) to verify or otherwise require documentation of damages prior
                        to processing the Damage Fee.
                    </li>
<li>
**Tolls**. In some instances tolls (or return tolls) may apply to
                        your ride. Please see our Help Center and your market’s Lyft Cities page for
                        more <a href="https://help.lyft.com/hc/articles/115012927787-Toll-info-for-passengers">
                        information about toll charges</a> and a list of applicable
                        <a href="https://help.lyft.com/hc/articles/213815078-List-of-Tolls">tolls
                        and return charges</a>. We do not guarantee that the amount charged by Lyft
                        will match the toll charged to the Driver, if any.
                    </li>
<li>
**Other Charges**. Other fee and surcharges may apply to your
                        ride, including: actual or anticipated airport fees, state or local fees, or
                        event fees as determined by Lyft or its marketing partners. In addition, where
                        required by law Lyft will collect applicable taxes. See your market's
                        Lyft Cities page for details on other Charges that may apply to your ride.
                    </li>
<li>
**Tips**. Following a ride, you may elect to tip your Driver in
                        cash or through the Lyft application. You may also elect to set a default tip
                        amount or percentage through the app; Any tips will be provided entirely to the
                        applicable Driver.
                    </li>


                    General.
                

<li>
**Facilitation of Charges**. All Charges are facilitated through a
                        third-party payment processor (e.g., First Data, Stripe, Inc., or Braintree, a
                        division of PayPal, Inc.). Lyft may replace its third-party payment processor
                        without notice to you. Charges shall only be made through the Lyft
                        Platform. With the exception of tips, cash payments are strictly prohibited.
                        Your payment of Charges to Lyft satisfies your payment obligation for your use
                        of the Lyft Platform and Rideshare Services. Lyft may group multiple charges
                        into a single aggregate transaction on your payment method based on the date(s)
                        they were incurred. If you don't recognize a transaction, then check your ride
                        receipts and payment history.
                    </li>
<li>
**No Refunds**. All Charges are non-refundable. This no-refund
                        policy shall apply at all times regardless of your decision to terminate usage
                        of the Lyft Platform, any disruption to the Lyft Platform or Rideshare Services,
                        or any other reason whatsoever.
                    </li>
<li>
**Coupons**. You may receive coupons that you can apply toward
                        payment of certain Charges upon completion of a Ride. Coupons are only valid
                        for use on the Lyft Platform, and are not transferable or redeemable for cash
                        except as required by law.  Coupons cannot be combined, and if the cost of your
                        ride exceeds the applicable credit or discount value we will charge your
                        payment method on file for the outstanding cost of the Ride. For quoted or
                        variable fares, Lyft may deduct the amount attributable to the Service Fee,
                        Tolls, or Other Charges before application of the coupon. Additional
                        restrictions on coupons may apply as communicated to you in a relevant
                        promotion or by clicking on the relevant coupon within the Promotions
                        section of the Lyft App.
                    </li>
<li>
**Credit Card Authorization**. Upon addition of a new payment
                        method or each ride request, Lyft may seek authorization of your selected
                        payment method to verify the payment method, ensure the ride cost will be
                        covered, and protect against unauthorized behavior. The authorization is not a
                        charge, however, it may reduce your available credit by the authorization
                        amount until your bank’s next processing cycle. Should the amount of our
                        authorization exceed the total funds on deposit in your account, you may be
                        subject to overdraft of NSF charges by the bank issuing your debit or prepaid
                        card. We cannot be held responsible for these charges and are unable to assist
                        you in recovering them from your issuing bank. Check out our Help Center to
                        learn more about <a href="https://help.lyft.com/hc/articles/214216577-I-m-Seeing-a-Charge-from-Lyft-on-my-Bank-Account">

                    property of their respective owners. You acknowledge and agree that any questions,
                    comments, suggestions, ideas, feedback or other information (“Submissions”)
                    provided by you to us are non-confidential and shall become the sole property of
                    Lyft. Lyft shall own exclusive rights, including all intellectual property rights,
                    and shall be entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of these

                    LYFT and other Lyft logos, designs, graphics, icons, scripts and service names are
                    registered trademarks, trademarks or trade dress of Lyft in the United States
                    and/or other countries (collectively, the “Lyft Marks”). If you provide Rideshare
                    Services as a Driver, Lyft grants to you, during the term of this Agreement, and
                    subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, a limited,
                    revocable, non-exclusive license to display and use the Lyft Marks solely on the
                    Lyft stickers/decals, Lyft Amp, and any other Lyft-Branded items provided by Lyft
                    directly to you in connection with providing the Rideshare Services ("License").
                    The License is non-transferable and non-assignable, and you shall not grant to any
                    third party any right, permission, license or sublicense with respect to any of the
                    rights granted hereunder without Lyft’s prior written permission, which it may
                    withhold in its sole discretion. The Lyft logo (or any Lyft Marks) may not be
                    used in any manner that is likely to cause confusion, including but not limited
                    to: use of a Lyft Mark in a domain name or Lyft referral code, or use of a Lyft
                    Mark as a social media handle or name, avatar, profile photo, icon, favicon,
                    or banner. You may identify yourself as a Driver on the Lyft Platform, but may
                    not misidentify yourself as Lyft, an employee of Lyft, or a representative of Lyft.
                


                    You acknowledge that Lyft is the owner and licensor of the Lyft Marks, including
                    all goodwill associated therewith, and that your use of the Lyft logo
                    (or any Lyft Marks) will confer no interest in or ownership of the Lyft Marks in you
                    but rather inures to the benefit of Lyft. You agree to use the Lyft logo strictly in
                    accordance with Lyft’s Trademark Usage Guidelines, as may be provided to you and revised
                    from time to time, and to immediately cease any use that Lyft determines to nonconforming
                    or otherwise unacceptable.
                


                    You agree that you will not: (1) create any materials that use the Lyft Marks or
                    any derivatives of the Lyft Marks as a trademark, service mark, trade name or trade
                    dress, other than as expressly approved by Lyft in writing; (2) use the Lyft Marks
                    in any way that tends to impair their validity as proprietary trademarks, service
                    marks, trade names or trade dress, or use the Lyft Marks other than in accordance
                    with the terms, conditions and restrictions herein; (3) take any other action that
                    would jeopardize or impair Lyft’s rights as owner of the Lyft Marks or the legality
                    and/or enforceability of the Lyft Marks, including, challenging or opposing Lyft’s
                    ownership in the Lyft Marks; (4) apply for trademark registration or renewal of
                    trademark registration of any of the Lyft Marks, any derivative of the Lyft Marks,
                    any combination of the Lyft Marks and any other name, or any trademark, service
                    mark, trade name, symbol or word which is similar to the Lyft Marks; (5) use the
                    Lyft Marks on or in connection with any product, service or activity that is in
                    violation of any law, statute, government regulation or standard.
                


                    You agree you will not rent, lease, lend, sell, or otherwise redistribute the
                    Lyft driver amp, or manufacture, produce, print, sell, distribute, purchase,
                    or display counterfeit/inauthentic Lyft driver amps or other Lyft Marks or
                    (including but not limited to signage, stickers, apparel, or decals) from any
                    source other than directly from Lyft.
                


                    Violation of any provision of this License may result in immediate termination of
                    the License, in Lyft’s sole discretion, a takedown request sent to the appropriate
                    ISP, or social media platform, and/or a Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution
                    Policy Proceeding (or equivalent proceeding). If you create any materials
                    (physical or digital) bearing the Lyft Marks (in violation of this Agreement
                    or otherwise), you agree that upon their creation Lyft exclusively owns all right,
                    title and interest in and to such materials, including any modifications to the
                    Lyft Marks or derivative works based on the Lyft Marks or Lyft copyrights.
                    You further agree to assign any interest or right you may have in such materials
                    to Lyft, and to provide information and execute any documents as reasonably
                    requested by Lyft to enable Lyft to formalize such assignment.
                


                    Lyft respects the intellectual property of others, and expects Users to do the
                    same. If you believe, in good faith, that any materials on the Lyft Platform
                    infringe upon your copyrights, please [view our Copyright Policy](https://www.lyft.com/copyright) for information
                    on how to make a copyright complaint.
                

## Disclaimers


                    The following disclaimers are made on behalf of Lyft, our affiliates, subsidiaries,
                    parents, successors and assigns, and each of our respective officers, directors,
                    employees, agents, and shareholders.
                


                    Lyft does not provide transportation services, and Lyft is not a transportation
                    carrier. Lyft is not a common carrier or public carrier. It is up to the Driver to
                    decide whether or not to offer a ride to a Rider contacted through the Lyft
                    Platform, and it is up to the Rider to decide whether or not to accept a ride from
                    any Driver contacted through the Lyft Platform. We cannot ensure that a Driver or
                    Rider will complete an arranged transportation service. We have no control over the
                    quality or safety of the transportation that occurs as a result of the Rideshare
                    Services.
                


                    The Lyft Platform is provided on an “as is” basis and without any warranty or
                    condition, express, implied or statutory. We do not guarantee and do not promise
                    any specific results from use of the Lyft Platform and/or the Rideshare Services,
                    including the ability to provide or receive Rideshare Services at any given location
                    or time. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we specifically disclaim any
                    implied warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and
                    non-infringement. Some states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so
                    the foregoing disclaimer may not apply to you.
                


                    We do not warrant that your use of the Lyft Platform or Rideshare Services will be
                    accurate, complete, reliable, current, secure, uninterrupted, always available, or
                    error- free, or will meet your requirements, that any defects in the Lyft Platform
                    will be corrected, or that the Lyft Platform is free of viruses or other harmful
                    components. We disclaim liability for, and no warranty is made with respect to,
                    connectivity and availability of the Lyft Platform or Rideshare Services.
                


                    We cannot guarantee that each Rider is who he or she claims to be. Please use
                    common sense when using the Lyft Platform and Rideshare Services, including looking
                    at the photos of the Driver or Rider you have matched with to make sure it is the
                    same individual you see in person. Please note that there are also risks of dealing
                    with underage persons or people acting under false pretense, and we do not accept
                    responsibility or liability for any content, communication or other use or access
                    of the Lyft Platform by persons under the age of 18 in violation of this Agreement.
                    We encourage you to communicate directly with each potential Driver or Rider prior
                    to engaging in an arranged transportation service.
                


                    Lyft is not responsible for the conduct, whether online or offline, of any User of
                    the Lyft Platform or Rideshare Services. You are solely responsible for your
                    interactions with other Users. We do not procure insurance for, nor are we
                    responsible for, personal belongings left in the car by Drivers or Riders. By using
                    the Lyft Platform and participating in the Rideshare Services, you agree to accept
                    such risks and agree that Lyft is not responsible for the acts or omissions of Users
                    on the Lyft Platform or participating in the Rideshare Services.
                


                    You are responsible for the use of your User account and Lyft expressly disclaims
                    any liability arising from the unauthorized use of your User account. Should you
                    suspect that any unauthorized party may be using your User account or you suspect
                    any other breach of security, you agree to notify us immediately.
                


                    It is possible for others to obtain information about you that you provide, publish
                    or post to or through the Lyft Platform (including any profile information you
                    provide), send to other Users, or share during the Rideshare Services, and to use
                    such information to harass or harm you. We are not responsible for the use of any
                    personal information that you disclose to other Users on the Lyft Platform or
                    through the Rideshare Services. Please carefully select the type of information that
                    you post on the Lyft Platform or through the Rideshare Services or release to others.
                    We disclaim all liability, regardless of the form of action, for the acts or omissions
                    of other Users (including unauthorized users, or “hackers”).
                


                    Opinions, advice, statements, offers, or other information or content concerning
                    Lyft or made available through the Lyft Platform, but not directly by us, are those
                    of their respective authors, and should not necessarily be relied upon. Such
                    authors are solely responsible for such content. Under no circumstances will we be
                    responsible for any loss or damage resulting from your reliance on information or
                    other content posted by third parties, whether on the Lyft Platform or otherwise.
                    We reserve the right, but we have no obligation, to monitor the materials posted on
                    the Lyft Platform and remove any such material that in our sole opinion violates,
                    or is alleged to violate, the law or this agreement or which might be offensive,
                    illegal, or that might violate the rights, harm, or threaten the safety of Users or
                    others.
                


                    Location data provided by the Lyft Platform is for basic location purposes only and
                    is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location information
                    is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate or incomplete location data may lead to
                    death, personal injury, property or environmental damage. Neither Lyft, nor any of
                    its content providers, guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
                    reliability, or timeliness of location data tracked or displayed by the Lyft
                    Platform. Any of your Information, including geolocational data, you upload,
                    provide, or post on the Lyft Platform may be accessible to Lyft and certain Users
                    of the Lyft Platform.
                


                    Lyft advises you to use the Lyft Platform with a data plan with unlimited or very
                    high data usage limits, and Lyft shall not responsible or liable for any fees,
                    costs, or overage charges associated with any data plan you use to access the Lyft
                    Platform.
                


                    This paragraph applies to any version of the Lyft Platform that you acquire from
                    the Apple App Store. This Agreement is entered into between you and Lyft. Apple,
                    Inc. (“Apple”) is not a party to this Agreement and shall have no obligations with
                    respect to the Lyft Platform. Lyft, not Apple, is solely responsible for the Lyft
                    Platform and the content thereof as set forth hereunder. However, Apple and Apple’s
                    subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement. Upon your acceptance
                    of this Agreement, Apple shall have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted
                    the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third party beneficiary
                    thereof. This Agreement incorporates by reference <a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula/">
                    Apple’s Licensed Application End User License Agreement</a>, for purposes of which,
                    you are “the end-user.” In the event of a conflict in the terms of the Licensed
                    Application End User License Agreement and this Agreement, the terms of this
                    Agreement shall control.
                


                    As a Driver, you may be able to use "Lyft Nav built by Google" while providing
                    Rideshare Services on the Platform. Riders and Drivers may also use Google Maps
                    while using the App. In either case, you agree that Google may collect your
                    location data when the Lyft App is running in order to provide and improve
                    Google's services, that such data may also be shared with Lyft in order to
                    improve its operations, and that Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/help/terms_maps.html">
                    terms</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_gl/policies/privacy/">
                    privacy policy</a> will apply to this usage.
                

## State and Local Disclosures


                    Certain jurisdictions require additional disclosures to you. You can view any
                    disclosures required by your local jurisdiction at [www.lyft.com/terms/disclosures](https://www.lyft.com/terms/disclosures).

## Indemnity


                    You will defend, indemnify, and hold Lyft including our affiliates, subsidiaries,
                    parents, successors and assigns, and each of our respective officers, directors,
                    employees, agents, or shareholders harmless from any claims, actions, suits,
                    losses, costs, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees)
                    relating to or arising out of your use of the Lyft Platform and participation in
                    the Rideshare Services, including: (1) your breach of this Agreement or the documents
                    it incorporates by reference;  (2) your violation of any law or the rights of a third
                    party, including, Drivers, Riders, other motorists, and pedestrians, as a result of
                    your own interaction with such third party; (3) any allegation that any materials
                    that you submit to us or transmit through the Lyft Platform or to us infringe or
                    otherwise violate the copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual
                    property or other rights of any third party; (4) your ownership, use or operation
                    of a motor vehicle or passenger vehicle, including your provision of Rideshare
                    Services as a Driver; and/or (5) any other activities in connection with the
                    Rideshare Services. This indemnity shall be applicable without regard to the
                    negligence of any party, including any indemnified person.
                

## Limitation of Liability


                    In no event will Lyft, including our affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, successors
                    and assigns, and each of our respective officers, directors, employees, agents, or
                    shareholders (collectively “Lyft” for purposes of this section), be liable to you
                    for any incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, consequential, or indirect
                    damages (including damages for deletion, corruption, loss of data, loss of
                    programs, failure to store any information or other content maintained or
                    transmitted by the Lyft Platform, service interruptions, or for the cost of
                    procurement of substitute services) arising out of or in connection with the Lyft
                    Platform, the Rideshare Services, or this Agreement, however arising including
                    negligence, even if we or our agents or representatives know or have been advised
                    of the possibility of such damages. The Lyft Platform may be used by you to request
                    and schedule transportation, goods, or other services with third party providers,
                    but you agree that Lyft has no responsibility or liability to you related to any
                    transportation, goods or other services provided to you by third party providers
                    other than as expressly set forth in this agreement. Certain jurisdictions may not
                    allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. If these laws apply to you,
                    some or all of the above disclaimers, exclusions or limitations may not apply to
                    you, and you may have additional rights.
                

## Term and Termination


                    This Agreement is effective upon your creation of a User account. This
                    Agreement may be terminated: a) by User, without cause, upon seven (7) days’
                    prior written notice to Lyft; or b) by either Party immediately, without
                    notice, upon the other Party’s material breach of this Agreement, including but
                    not limited to any breach of Section 9 or breach of Section 10(a) through (i)
                    of this Agreement. In addition, Lyft may terminate this Agreement or deactivate
                    your User account immediately in the event: (1) you no longer qualify to
                    provide Rideshare Services or to operate the approved vehicle under applicable
                    law, rule, permit, ordinance or regulation; (2) you fall below Lyft’s star rating
                    or cancellation threshold; (3) Lyft has the good faith belief that such action is
                    necessary to protect the safety of the Lyft community or third parties,
                    provided that in the event of a deactivation pursuant to (1)-(3) above, you
                    will be given notice of the potential or actual deactivation and an opportunity
                    to attempt to cure the issue to Lyft’s reasonable satisfaction prior to Lyft
                    permanently terminating the Agreement. For all other breaches of this
                    Agreement, you will be provided notice and an opportunity to cure the breach.
                    If the breach is cured in a timely manner and to Lyft’s satisfaction, this
                    Agreement will not be permanently terminated. Sections 2, 6, 7 (with respect to
                    the license), 11-12, 14-19, and 21 shall survive any termination or expiration
                    of this Agreement.
                

## Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement

##### 
                    (a) Agreement to Binding Arbitration Between You and Lyft.
                


You and Lyft mutually agree to waive our respective
                    rights to resolution of disputes in a court of law by a judge or jury and agree
                    to resolve any dispute by arbitration, as set forth below. This
                    agreement to arbitrate (“Arbitration Agreement”) is governed by the Federal
                    Arbitration Act and survives after the Agreement terminates or your
                    relationship with Lyft ends. Any arbitration under this
                    Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class
                    actions are not permitted. Except as expressly provided below, this
                    Arbitration Agreement applies to all Claims (defined below) between you and
                    Lyft, including our affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, successors and assigns,

                    shareholders. This Arbitration Agreement also applies to claims between you and
                    Lyft’s service providers, including but not limited to background check providers
                    and payment processors; and such service providers shall be considered intended
                    third party beneficiaries of this Arbitration Agreement.
                


                    Except as expressly provided below, all disputes and claims
                    between us (each a “Claim” and collectively, “Claims”) shall be exclusively
                    resolved by binding arbitration solely between you and Lyft. These Claims
                    include, but are not limited to, any dispute, claim or controversy, whether based
                    on past, present, or future events, arising out of or relating to: this Agreement
                    and prior versions thereof (including the breach, termination, enforcement,
                    interpretation or validity thereof), the Lyft Platform, the Rideshare Services,
                    rental or use of bikes or scooters through the Lyft Platform, Lyft promotions,

                    available through the Lyft Platform, your relationship with Lyft, the threatened
                    or actual suspension, deactivation or termination of your User Account or this
                    Agreement, background checks performed by or on Lyft’s behalf, payments
                    made by you or any payments made or allegedly owed to you, any promotions

                    secrets, unfair competition, compensation, breaks and rest periods, expense
                    reimbursement, wrongful termination, discrimination, harassment, retaliation,

                    covenant, claims arising under federal or state consumer protection laws; claims
                    arising under antitrust laws, claims arising under the Telephone Consumer
                    Protection Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act; and claims arising under the Uniform

                    1974 or funded by insurance), and state statutes, if any, addressing the same or
                    similar subject matters, and all other federal and state statutory and common law
                    claims. All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a Claim (including disputes
                    about the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of the
                    Arbitration Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator, except as expressly
                    provided below.
                


By agreeing to arbitration, you understand that you and
                    Lyft are waiving the right to sue in court or have a jury trial for all Claims,
                    except as expressly otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.
                    This Arbitration Agreement is intended to require arbitration of every claim or
                    dispute that can lawfully be arbitrated, except for those claims and disputes
                    which by the terms of this Arbitration Agreement are expressly excluded from
                    the requirement to arbitrate.
                

##### 
                    (b) Prohibition of Class Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.
                


                    You understand and agree that you and Lyft may each bring Claims in arbitration
                    against the other only in an individual capacity and not on a class, collective
                    action, or representative basis (“Class Action Waiver”).  You understand and
                    agree that you and Lyft both are waiving the right to pursue or have a dispute
                    resolved as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective or
                    representative proceeding.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this subsection (b)
                    shall not apply to representative private attorneys general act claims brought
                    against Lyft, which are addressed separately in Section 17(c).
                


                    The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue
                    any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. The arbitrator shall have
                    no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on a class,
                    collective, or representative basis. The arbitrator may award declaratory or
                    injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to
                    the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claims.
                


                    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement
                    or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability,
                    revocability or validity of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a
                    civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in
                    which: (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action
                    and (2) there is a final judicial determination that the Class Action Waiver is
                    unenforceable with respect to any Claim or any particular remedy for a Claim
                    (such as a request for public injunctive relief), then that Claim or particular
                    remedy (and only that Claim or particular remedy) shall be severed from any
                    remaining claims and/or remedies and may be brought in a civil court of
                    competent jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver shall be enforced in
                    arbitration on an individual basis as to all other Claims or remedies to the
                    fullest extent possible.
                

##### 
                    (c) Representative PAGA Waiver.
                


                    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Arbitration
                    Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law: (1) you and Lyft agree not
                    to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the Private
                    Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”), California Labor Code § 2698 et seq.,
                    in any court or in arbitration, and (2) for any claim brought on a private
                    attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, both you and Lyft
                    agree that any such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual
                    basis only (i.e., to resolve whether you have personally been aggrieved or
                    subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to
                    resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective
                    proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or
                    subject to any violations of law) (collectively, “representative PAGA Waiver”).
                    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration
                    Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability,
                    enforceability, revocability or validity of this representative PAGA Waiver may
                    be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an
                    arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be
                    unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the unenforceable provision shall
                    be severed from this Agreement; (ii) severance of the unenforceable provision
                    shall have no impact whatsoever on the Arbitration Agreement or the requirement
                    that any remaining Claims be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the
                    Arbitration Agreement; and (iii) any such representative PAGA or other
                    representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a
                    civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent
                    that there are any Claims to be litigated in a civil court of competent
                    jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that
                    the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those Claims,
                    the Parties agree that litigation of those Claims shall be stayed pending the
                    outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration.
                

##### 
                    (d) Rules Governing the Arbitration.
                


                    Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement shall be
                    administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) pursuant to its
                    <a href="https://www.adr.org/aaa/faces/rules/searchrules/rulesdetail?_afrWindowId=57rsw71ei_1&amp;_afrLoop=1335893675945842&amp;doc=ADRSTAGE2021424&amp;_afrWindowMode=0&amp;_adf.ctrl-state=hf27f5iaa_4#%40%3F_afrWindowId%3D57rsw71ei_1%26_afrLoop%3D1335893675945842%26doc%3DADRSTAGE2021424%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3D57rsw71ei_79">
                    Consumer Arbitration Rules</a> that are in effect at the time the arbitration
                    is initiated, as modified by the terms set forth in this Agreement. Copies of
                    these rules can be obtained at the AAA’s website (www.adr.org) (the “AAA
                    Rules”) or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
                    if requested by you and if proper based on the facts and circumstances of the
                    Claims presented, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select a
                    different set of AAA Rules, but in no event shall the arbitrator consolidate
                    more than one person’s Claims, or otherwise preside over any form of
                    representative, collective, or class proceeding. The parties may select a
                    different arbitration administrator upon mutual written agreement.
                


                    As part of the arbitration, both you and Lyft will have the opportunity for
                    reasonable discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the
                    Claim. The arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be
                    available in court. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief
                    only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
                    necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claims. The
                    arbitrator will provide a reasoned written statement of the arbitrator’s
                    decision which shall explain the award given and the findings and conclusions
                    on which the decision is based.
                


                    The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with
                    applicable law, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The
                    arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving
                    different Riders or Drivers, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations
                    involving the same Rider or Driver to the extent required by applicable law.
                    The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award
                    rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
                    thereof, provided that any award may be challenged in a court of competent
                    jurisdiction.
                

##### 
                    (e) Arbitration Fees and Awards.
                


                    The payment of filing and arbitration fees will be governed by the relevant AAA
                    Rules subject to the following modifications:
                

<li>
                        If Lyft initiates arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, Lyft will
                        pay all AAA filing and arbitration fees.
                    </li>
<li>
                        With respect to any Claims brought by Lyft against a Driver, or for Claims
                        brought by a Driver against Lyft that: (A) are based on an alleged employment
                        relationship between Lyft and a Driver; (B) arise out of, or relate to, Lyft’s
                        actual deactivation of a Driver’s User account or a threat by Lyft to
                        deactivate a Driver’s User account; (C) arise out of, or relate to, Lyft’s
                        actual termination of a Driver’s Agreement with Lyft under the termination
                        provisions of this Agreement, or a threat by Lyft to terminate a Driver’s
                        Agreement; (D) arise out of, or relate to, Fares (as defined in this Agreement,
                        including Lyft’s commission or fees on the Fares), tips, or average hourly
                        guarantees owed by Lyft to Drivers for Rideshare Services, other than disputes
                        relating to referral bonuses, other Lyft promotions, or consumer-type disputes,
                        or (E) arise out of or relate to background checks performed in connection with
                        a user seeking to become a Driver (the subset of Claims in subsections (A)-(E)
                        shall be collectively referred to as “Driver Claims”), Lyft shall pay all costs
                        unique to arbitration (as compared to the costs of adjudicating the same claims
                        before a court), including the regular and customary arbitration fees and
                        expenses (to the extent not paid by Lyft pursuant to the fee provisions above).
                        However, if you are the party initiating the Driver Claim, you shall be
                        responsible for contributing up to an amount equal to the filing fee that would
                        be paid to initiate the claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state
                        in which you provide Rideshare Services to Riders, unless a lower fee amount would
                        be owed by you pursuant to the AAA Rules, applicable law, or subsection (e)(1)
                        above.  Any dispute as to whether a cost is unique to arbitration shall be
                        resolved by the arbitrator. For purposes of this Section 17(e)(3), the term
                        “Driver” shall be deemed to include both Drivers and Driver applicants who have
                        not been approved to drive.
                    </li>
<li>
                        Except as provided in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 or any state
                        equivalents, each party shall pay its own attorneys’ fees and pay any costs
                        that are not unique to the arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would
                        incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a court such as costs to subpoena
                        witnesses and/or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition
                        transcripts, copy documents, etc.).
                    </li>
<li>
                        At the end of any arbitration, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees and
                        costs or any portion thereof to you if you prevail, to the extent
                        authorized by applicable law.
                    </li>
<li>
                        Although under some laws Lyft may have a right to an award of attorneys'
                        fees and non-filing fee expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, Lyft
                        agrees that it will not seek such an award unless you are represented by an
                        attorney or the arbitrator has determined that the claim is frivolous or
                        brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards of Federal Rule
                        of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
                    </li>
<li>
                        If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of
                        Lyft’s last written settlement offer made after you participated in good
                        faith in the optional Negotiation process described in subsection (k)
                        below, then Lyft will pay you the amount of the award or U.S. $1,000,
                        whichever is greater.
                    </li>

##### 
                    (f) Location and Manner of Arbitration.
                


                    Unless you and Lyft agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings between Lyft and
                    a Rider will take place in the county of your billing address, and any
                    arbitration hearings between Lyft and a Driver will take place in the county in
                    which the Driver provides Rideshare Services. If AAA arbitration is unavailable
                    in your county, the arbitration hearings will take place in the nearest available
                    location for a AAA arbitration. Your right to a hearing will be determined by the
                    AAA Rules.
                

##### 
                    (g) Exceptions to Arbitration.
                


                    This Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following types of
                    claims: (1) small claims actions brought on an individual basis that are within the
                    scope of such small claims court’s jurisdiction; (2) a representative action
                    brought on behalf of others under PAGA or other private attorneys general acts, to
                    the extent the representative PAGA Waiver in Section 17(c) of such action is deemed
                    unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction under applicable law not
                    preempted by the FAA; (3) claims for workers’ compensation, state disability
                    insurance and unemployment insurance benefits; (4) claims that may not be
                    subject to arbitration as a matter of generally applicable law not preempted by the
                    FAA; and (5) individual claims of sexual assault or sexual harassment in connection
                    with the use of the Lyft Platform or Rideshare Services. Where these claims are
                    brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, Lyft will not require arbitration of
                    those claims. Lyft's agreement not to require arbitration of these claims does not
                    waive the enforceability of any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement
                    (including without limitation the waivers provided in Section 17(b)), or of the
                    enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement as to any other dispute, claim, or
                    controversy.

                


                    Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prevents you from making a report to or
                    filing a claim or charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S.
                    Department of Labor, Securities Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board
                    (“NLRB”), or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, or similar local,
                    state or federal agency, and nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed
                    to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any
                    agency in order to fulfill the party's obligation to exhaust administrative
                    remedies before making a claim in arbitration  However, should you bring an
                    administrative claim, you may only seek or recover money damages of any type
                    pursuant to this Arbitration Provision, and you knowingly and voluntarily waive the
                    right to seek or recover money damages of any type pursuant to any administrative
                    complaint, except for a complaint issued by the NLRB.  Should you participate in an
                    NLRB proceeding, you may only recover money damages if such recovery does not arise
                    from or relate to a claim previously adjudicated under this Arbitration Provision
                    or settled by you.  Similarly, you may not recover money damages under this
                    Arbitration Provision if you have already adjudicated such claim with the NLRB.
                    Nothing in this Agreement or Arbitration Agreement prevents your participation in
                    an investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise
                    covered by this Arbitration Provision.
                

##### 
                    (h) Severability.
                


                    In addition to the severability provisions in subsections (b) and (c) above, in
                    the event  that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or
                    unenforceable  under applicable law not preempted by the FAA, such provision
                    shall be severed and  the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given
                    full force and effect.
                

##### 
                    (i) Driver Claims in Pending Settlement.
                


                    If you are a member of a putative class in a lawsuit against Lyft involving
                    Driver Claims and a Motion for Preliminary Approval of a Settlement has been
                    filed with the court in that lawsuit prior to this Agreement’s effective date
                    (a “Pending Settlement Action”), then this Arbitration Agreement shall not
                    apply to your Driver Claims in that particular class action. Instead, your
                    Driver Claims in that Pending Settlement Action shall continue to be governed
                    by the arbitration provisions contained in the applicable Agreement that you
                    accepted prior to this Agreement’s effective date.
                

##### 
                    (j)  Opting Out of Arbitration for Driver Claims That Are Not In a Pending
                    Settlement Action.
                


                    As a Driver or Driver applicant, you may opt out of the requirement to arbitrate
                    Driver Claims defined in Section 17(e)(3) (except as limited by Section 17(i)
                    above) pursuant to the terms of this subsection if you have not previously
                    agreed to an arbitration provision in Lyft’s Terms of Service where you had the
                    opportunity to opt out of the requirement to arbitrate. If you have previously
                    agreed to such an arbitration provision, you may opt out of any revisions to
                    your prior arbitration agreement made by this provision in the manner specified
                    below, but opting out of this arbitration provision has no effect on any
                    previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with Lyft.
                    If you have not previously agreed to such an arbitration provision and do not
                    wish to be subject to this Arbitration Agreement with respect to Driver Claims,
                    you may opt out of arbitration with respect to such Driver Claims, other than
                    those in a Pending Settlement Action, by notifying Lyft in writing of your
                    desire to opt out of arbitration for such Driver Claims, which writing must be
                    dated, signed and delivered by electronic mail to arbitrationoptout@lyft.com.
                


                    In order to be effective, (A) the writing must clearly indicate your intent to
                    opt out of this Arbitration Agreement with respect to Driver Claims that are
                    not part of a Pending Settlement Action, (B) the writing must include the name,
                    phone number, and email address associated with your User Account, and (C) the
                    email containing the signed writing must be sent within 30 days of  the date
                    this Agreement is executed by you. Should you not opt out within the  30-day
                    period, you and Lyft shall be bound by the terms of this Arbitration  Agreement
                    in full (including with respect to Driver Claims that are not part of  a Pending
                    Settlement Action). As provided in paragraph 17(i) above, any opt out  that you
                    submit shall not apply to any Driver Claims that are part of a Pending
                    Settlement Action and your Driver Claims in any such Pending Settlement Action
                    shall continue to be governed by the arbitration provisions that are contained
                    in the applicable Lyft Terms of Use that you agreed to prior to the effective
                    date of this Agreement.
                


                    Cases have been filed against Lyft and may be filed in the future involving
                    Driver Claims. You should assume that there are now, and may be in the future,
                    lawsuits against Lyft alleging class, collective, and/or representative Driver
                    Claims in which the plaintiffs seek to act on your behalf, and which, if
                    successful, could result in some monetary recovery to you. But if you do agree
                    to arbitration of Driver Claims with Lyft under this Arbitration Agreement, you
                    are agreeing in advance that you will bring all such claims, and seek all
                    monetary and other relief, against Lyft in an individual arbitration,  except
                    for the Driver Claims that are part of a Pending Settlement Action. You  are
                    also agreeing in advance that you will not participate in, or seek to  recover
                    monetary or other relief, for such claims in any court action or class,
                    collective, and/or representative action. You have the right to consult with
                    counsel of your choice concerning this Arbitration Agreement and you will not
                    be subject to retaliation if you exercise your right to assert claims or opt-
                    out of any Driver Claims under this Arbitration Agreement.
                

##### 
                    (k) Optional Pre-Arbitration Negotiation Process.
                


                    Before initiating any arbitration or proceeding, you and Lyft may agree to
                    first attempt to negotiate any dispute, claim or controversy between the
                    parties informally for 30 days, unless this time period is mutually extended by
                    you and Lyft. A party who intends to seek negotiation under this subsection
                    must first send to the other a written notice of the dispute (“Notice”). The
                    Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2)
                    set forth the specific relief sought. All offers, promises, conduct and
                    statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the negotiation by
                    any of the parties, their agents, employees, and attorneys are confidential,
                    privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including as evidence of liability
                    or for impeachment, in arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties,
                    provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not
                    be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the
                    negotiation.
                

## Confidentiality


                    You agree not to use any technical, financial, strategic and other proprietary and
                    confidential information relating to Lyft’s business, operations and properties,
                    information about a User made available to you in connection with such User’s use
                    of the Platform, which may include the User’s name, pick-up location, contact
                    information and photo (“Confidential Information”) disclosed to you by Lyft for
                    your own use or for any purpose other than as contemplated herein. You shall not
                    disclose or permit disclosure of any Confidential Information to third parties,
                    and you agree not to store separate and outside of the Lyft Platform any User
                    Information obtained from the Lyft Platform. As a Driver, you understand that some
                    of Rider Information you receive may be protected by federal and/or state
                    confidentiality laws, such as the Health Information Portability and Accountability
                    Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), governing the privacy and security of protected (patient)
                    health information. In the event that you know a Rider, you should not disclose
                    to anyone the identity of the Rider or the location that you picked up, or dropped
                    of the Rider as this could violate HIPAA. You understand that any violation of the
                    Agreement's confidentiality provisions may violate HIPAA or state confidentiality
                    laws and could result in civil or criminal penalties against you. You agree to
                    take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure
                    or use of Confidential Information of Lyft in order to prevent it from
                    falling into the public domain. Notwithstanding the above, you shall not have
                    liability to Lyft with regard to any Confidential Information which you can prove:
                    was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed by Lyft or has entered the
                    public domain through no fault of yours; was known to you, without restriction, at
                    the time of disclosure, as demonstrated by files in existence at the time of
                    disclosure; is disclosed with the prior written approval of Lyft; becomes known to
                    you, without restriction, from a source other than Lyft without breach of this
                    Agreement by you and otherwise not in violation of Lyft’s rights; or is disclosed
                    pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other
                    governmental body; provided, however, that You shall provide prompt notice of such
                    court order or requirement to Lyft to enable Lyft to seek a protective order or
                    otherwise prevent or restrict such disclosure.
                

## Relationship with Lyft


                    As a Driver on the Lyft Platform, you acknowledge and agree that you and Lyft are
                    in a direct business relationship, and the relationship between the parties under
                    this Agreement is solely that of independent contracting parties.  You and Lyft
                    expressly agree that (1) this is not an employment agreement and does not create an
                    employment relationship between you and Lyft; and (2) no joint venture, franchisor-
                    franchisee, partnership, or agency relationship is intended or created by this
                    Agreement.  You have no authority to bind Lyft, and you undertake not to hold
                    yourself out as an employee, agent or authorized representative of Lyft.
                


                    Lyft does not, and shall not be deemed to, direct or control you generally or
                    in your performance under this Agreement specifically, including in connection
                    with your provision of Rideshare Services, your acts or omissions, or your
                    operation and maintenance of your vehicle. You retain the sole right to determine
                    when, where, and for how long you will utilize the Lyft Platform. You retain the
                    option to accept or to decline or ignore a Rider’s request for Rideshare Services
                    via the Lyft Platform, or to cancel an accepted request for Rideshare Services
                    via the Lyft Platform, subject to Lyft’s then-current cancellation policies.
                    With the exception of any signage required by law or permit/license rules or
                    requirements, Lyft shall have no right to require you to: (a) display Lyft’s
                    names, logos or colors on your vehicle(s); or (b) wear a uniform or any other
                    clothing displaying Lyft’s names, logos or colors. You acknowledge and agree
                    that you have complete discretion to provide Rideshare Services or otherwise
                    engage in other business or employment activities.
                

## Other Services


                    In addition to connecting Riders with Drivers, the Lyft Platform may enable
                    Users to provide or receive services from other third parties. For
                    example, Users may be able to use the Lyft Platform to plan and reserve
                    rides on public transportation, take a ride in an autonomous vehicle
                    provided by a third party, rent vehicles, or obtain financial services
                    provided by third parties (collectively, the “Other Services”). You understand
                    and that the Other Services are subject to the terms and pricing of the
                    third-party provider. If you choose to purchase Other Services through the
                    Lyft Platform, you authorize Lyft to charge your payment method on file
                    according to the pricing terms set by the third-party provider. You agree that
                    Lyft is not responsible and may not be held liable for the Other Services or
                    the actions or omissions of the third-party provider. Such Other Services may
                    not be investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy, appropriateness, or
                    completeness by us, and we are not responsible for any Other Services
                    accessed through the Lyft Platform.
                

## General


                    Except as provided in Section 17, this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of
                    the State of California without regard to choice of law principles. This choice of
                    law provision is only intended to specify the use of California law to interpret
                    this Agreement and is not intended to create any other substantive right to non-
                    Californians to assert claims under California law whether by statute, common law,
                    or otherwise.  If any provision of this Agreement is or becomes invalid or non-
                    binding, the parties shall remain bound by all other provisions of this Agreement.
                    In that event, the parties shall replace the invalid or non-binding provision with
                    provisions that are valid and binding and that have, to the  greatest extent
                    possible, a similar effect as the invalid or non-binding provision, given the
                    contents and purpose of this Agreement.  You agree that this Agreement and all
                    incorporated agreements may be automatically assigned by Lyft, in our sole
                    discretion by providing notice to you. Except as explicitly stated otherwise, any
                    notices to Lyft shall be given by certified mail, postage prepaid and return
                    receipt requested to Lyft, Inc., 548 Market Street, #68514 San Francisco, CA
                    94104. Any notices to you shall be provided to you through the Lyft Platform or
                    given to you via the email address or physical you provide to Lyft during the
                    registration process. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way
                    define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section. The words
                    “include”, “includes” and “including” are deemed to be followed by the words
                    “without limitation”. A party’s failure to act with respect to a breach by the
                    other party does not constitute a waiver of the party’s right to act with respect
                    to subsequent or similar breaches. This Agreement sets forth the entire
                    understanding and agreement between you and Lyft with respect to the subject matter
                    hereof and supersedes all previous understandings and agreements between the
                    parties, whether oral or written.
                


                    If you have any questions regarding the Lyft Platform or Rideshare Services,
                    please contact us through our [Help Center](https://help.lyft.com/).

                    Lyft Privacy Policy
                

**Last Updated: February 8, 2017**


                    At Lyft, we want to connect people through transportation and bring
                    communities together. In this privacy policy, we tell you what information
                    we receive from Lyft riders and drivers, and how we use it to connect
                    riders with drivers and continue to improve our services. Below, we
                    explain how you can share with other riders and drivers in the Lyft
                    community as part of our mission to bring people together.
                

## Scope of this Privacy Policy


                    Lyft (“Lyft,” “we,” “our,” and/or “us”) values the privacy of individuals
                    who use our application, websites, and related services (collectively, the
                    “Lyft Platform ”). This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) explains how
                    we collect, use, and share information from Lyft users (“Users”),
                    comprised of both Lyft riders (“Riders”) and Lyft drivers  (including
                    Driver applicants) (“Drivers”). Beyond the Privacy Policy, your use of
                    Lyft is also subject to our Terms of Service (
                    [www.lyft.com/terms](https://www.lyft.com/terms)).
                

## Information We Collect

### A.  Information You Provide to Us


**Registration Information**. When you sign up for a Lyft
                        account, you give us your name, email address, and phone number. If
                        you decide to sign up for Lyft using your Facebook account, we will
                        also get basic information from your Facebook profile like your name,
                        gender, profile photo, and Facebook friends.
                    


**User Profile Information**. When you join the Lyft
                        community, you can create a Lyft Profile to share fun facts about
                        yourself, and discover mutual friends and interests. Filling out a
                        profile is optional, and you can share as little or as much as you
                        want. Your name (and for Drivers, Profile photos) is always part of
                        your Profile. Read more below about how you can control who sees your
                        Profile. You can also add a Business Profile to your account, which
                        requires a designated business email address and payment method.
                    


**Payment Method**. When you add a credit card or payment
                        method to your Lyft account, a third party that handles payments for
                        us will receive your card information. To keep your financial data
                        secure, we do not store full credit card information on our servers.
                    


**Communications**. If you contact us directly, we may
                        receive additional information about you. For example, when you
                        contact our Customer Support Team, we will receive your name, email
                        address, phone number, the contents of a message or attachments that
                        you may send to us, and other information you choose to provide.
                    


**Driver Application Information**. If you decide to join
                        our Lyft driver community, in addition to the basic registration
                        information we ask you for your date of birth, physical address,
                        Social Security number, driver’s license information, vehicle
                        information, car insurance information, and in some jurisdictions we
                        may collect additional business license or permitting information. We
                        share this information with our partners who help us by running
                        background checks on Drivers to help protect the Lyft community.
                    


**Payment Information**. To make sure Drivers get paid,
                        we keep information about Drivers’ bank routing numbers, tax
                        information, and any other payment information provided by Drivers.
                    

### B.  Information We Collect When You Use the Lyft Platform


**Location Information**. Lyft is all about connecting
                        Drivers and Riders. To do this, we need to know where you are. When
                        you open Lyft on your mobile device, we receive your location. We may
                        also collect the precise location of your device when the app is
                        running in the foreground or background. If you label certain
                        locations, such as “home” and “work,” we receive that information,
                        too.
                    


                        Your location information is necessary for things like matching Riders
                        with nearby Drivers, determining drop off and pick up locations, and
                        suggesting destinations based on previous trips. Also, if the need
                        ever arises, our Trust &amp; Safety team may use and share location
                        information to help protect the safety of Lyft Users or a member of
                        the public. In addition to the reasons described above, Drivers’
                        location information and distance travelled is necessary for
                        calculating charges and insurance for Lyft rides. If you give us
                        permission through your device settings or Lyft app, we may collect
                        your location while the app is off to identify promotions or service
                        updates in your area.
                    


**Device Information**. Lyft receives information from
                        Users’ devices, including IP address, web browser type, mobile
                        operating system version, phone carrier and manufacturer, application
                        installations, device identifiers, mobile advertising identifiers,
                        push notification tokens, and, if you register with your Facebook
                        account, your Facebook identifier. We collect mobile sensor data from
                        Drivers’ devices (such as speed, direction, height, acceleration or
                        deceleration) to improve location accuracy and analyze usage patterns.
                    


**Usage Information**. To help us understand how you use
                        the Lyft Platform and to help us improve it, we automatically receive
                        information about your interactions with the Lyft Platform, like the
                        pages or other content you view, your actions within the Lyft app, and
                        the dates and times of your visits.
                    


**Call and Text Information**. We work with a third party
                        partner to facilitate phone calls and text messages between Riders and
                        Drivers who have been connected for a ride. We receive information
                        about these communications including the date and time of the call or
                        SMS message, the parties’ phone numbers, and the content of any SMS
                        messages.  For security purposes, we may also monitor and/or record
                        the contents of phone calls made on the Lyft Platform, such as those
                        between Riders and Drivers.  You will be given notice that your call
                        may be recorded, and by proceeding you agree to allow Lyft to monitor
                        and/or record your call.
                    


**User Feedback**. At Lyft, we want to make sure Users
                        are always enjoying great rides. Riders and Drivers may rate and
                        review each other at the end of every ride. We receive information
                        about ratings and reviews and, as we explain below, give Riders
                        information about Drivers’ ratings and reviews and vice versa.
                    


**Address Book Contacts**. If you permit Lyft to access
                        the address book on your device through the permission system used by
                        your mobile platform, we may access and store names and contact
                        information from your address book to facilitate invitations and
                        social interactions that you initiate through our Platform and for
                        other purposes described in this privacy policy or at the time of
                        consent or collection.
                    


**Information from Cookies and Similar Technologies**. We
                        collect information through the use of “cookies”, tracking pixels, and
                        similar technologies to understand how you navigate through the Lyft
                        Platform and interact with Lyft advertisements, to learn what content
                        is popular, and to save your preferences. Cookies are small text files
                        that web servers place on your device; they are designed to store
                        basic information and to help websites and apps recognize your
                        browser.  We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A
                        session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent
                        cookie remains after you close your browser and may be accessed every
                        time you use the Lyft Platform.  You should consult your web
                        browser(s) to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you
                        delete or choose not to accept cookies from us, you may be missing out
                        on certain features of the Lyft Platform.
                    

### C.  Information We Collect from Third Parties


**Third Party Services**. If you choose to register for
                        Lyft or otherwise link your Lyft account with a third party’s service
                        (such as Facebook), we may receive the same type of information we
                        collect from you (described above) directly from those services.
                    


**Third Party Partners**. We may receive additional
                        information about you, such as demographic data, payment information,
                        or fraud detection information, from third party partners and combine
                        it with other information that we have about you.
                    


**Enterprise Programs**. If your company, university, or
                        organization participates in one of our enterprise programs such as
                        Lyft for Work, we may receive information about you, such as your
                        email address, from your participating organization. We also may give
                        your participating organization the opportunity to request a ride on
                        your behalf, in which case they may provide us with your name, phone
                        number, and the pickup and drop off location for your ride.
                    


**Background Information on Drivers**. Lyft works with
                        third party partners to perform driving record and criminal background
                        checks on Drivers, and we receive information from them such as
                        publicly available information about a Driver’s driving record or
                        criminal history.

                    </li>

## How We Share the Information We Collect

### A. Sharing Between Users


**Sharing between Riders and Drivers**. Riders and Drivers that
                        have been matched for a ride are able to see basic information about
                        each other, such as names, photo, ratings, and any information they
                        have added to their Profiles. Riders and Drivers who connect their
                        Lyft accounts to Facebook will also be able to see their mutual
                        Facebook friends during the ride. Drivers see the pick-up location
                        that the Rider has provided. Riders see a Driver’s vehicle information
                        and real-time location as the Driver approaches the pick-up location.
                        Riders’ ratings of Drivers are shared with Drivers on a weekly basis.
                        We de-identify the ratings and feedback, but we can’t rule out that a
                        driver may be able to identify the Rider that provided the rating or
                        feedback.
                    


                        Although we help Riders and Drivers communicate with one another to
                        arrange a pickup, we do not share your actual phone number or other
                        contact information with other Users.  If you report a lost or found
                        item to us, we will seek to connect you with the relevant Rider or
                        Driver, including sharing actual contact information with your
                        permission.
                    


**Sharing between Lyft Line Riders**. If you use Lyft
                        Line, Riders who have been matched with you will be able to see your
                        name, photo and any information you have added to your Profile. If you
                        connect your Lyft account to Facebook (such as by signing up through
                        Facebook), we may show your mutual friends with other Riders who are
                        also connected via Facebook.  During the Lyft Line matching process we
                        may show photos of possible matches to you and other Riders.
                    

### B. Sharing Between Lyft and Third Parties


**API and Integration Partners**.  If you connect to the
                        Lyft Platform through an integration with a third party service, we
                        may share information about your use of the Lyft Platform with that
                        third party.  We may share your information with our third party
                        partners in order to receive additional information about you.  We may
                        also share your information with third party partners to create offers
                        that may be of interest to you.
                    


**Third Party Services**.  The Lyft Platform may allow
                        you to connect with other websites, products, or services that we
                        don’t have control over (for example, we may give you the ability to
                        order a food delivery from a restaurant from within the Lyft app). If
                        you use these services, we will provide the third party with
                        information about you to allow them to provide the service to you (for
                        example, we would give the restaurant your name, phone number and
                        address to drop off the food).  We can’t speak to the privacy
                        practices of these third parties, and we encourage you to read their
                        privacy policies before deciding whether to use their services.
                    


**Service Providers**.  We work with third party service
                        providers to perform services on our behalf, and we may share your
                        information with such service providers to help us provide the Lyft
                        Platform, including all of the things described in Section 3 above.
                    


**Enterprise Partners**.  If you participate in an
                        enterprise program and charge a ride to your organization’s billing
                        method or credits, we will provide your organization’s account holder
                        with information about your use of the Lyft Platform, including ride
                        details such as date, time, charge, and pick up and drop off
                        locations. If you create a Business Profile, at the end of each ride
                        you will have the option to designate the ride as a business ride. If
                        you do so, and your organization has a corporate account with Lyft, we
                        may share information about your use of Lyft Platform with your
                        organization including ride details such as date, time, charge, and
                        region of the trip. If you change organizations, it is your
                        responsibility to update your Business Profile with the new
                        information.  (Please remember to check and set your designation
                        settings accordingly.) If you integrate your account with an expense
                        platform (like Concur) we will share the ride details to your expense
                        account.
                    


**International Partners**.  We’ve partnered with several
                        ride-sharing services around the globe so Riders can continue to find
                        rides when they open the Lyft app abroad, and Drivers can provide
                        services to international travelers in the U.S.  When we match a ride
                        with the partner, we share the same information that is shared between
                        matched Riders and Drivers on the Lyft Platform. In some cases we are
                        unable to mask your phone number if you call an international driver,
                        so please keep that in mind before using this feature.
                    


**Other Sharing**.  We may share your information with
                        third parties in the following cases:
                    

<li>
                            While negotiating or in relation to a change of corporate control
                            such as a restructuring, merger or sale of our assets;
                        </li>
<li>
                            If a government authority requests information and we think
                            disclosure is required or appropriate in order to comply with
                            laws, regulations, or a legal process;
                        </li>
<li>
                            With law enforcement officials, government authorities, or third
                            parties if we think doing so is necessary to protect the rights,
                            property, or safety of the Lyft community, Lyft, or the public
                            (you can read more about this in our
                            <a href="https://help.lyft.com/hc/articles/214218437-Law-Enforcement-Requests">
                            Law Enforcement Request</a> policy);
                        </li>
<li>
                            To comply with a legal requirement or process, including but not
                            limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other
                            compulsory disclosures.
                        </li>
<li>
                            If you signed up for a promotion with another User’s referral or
                            promotion code, with your referrer to let them know about your
                            redemption of or qualification for the promotion;
                        </li>
<li>
                            With our insurance partners to help determine and provide relevant
                            coverage in the event of an incident;
                        </li>
<li>
                            To provide information about the use of the Lyft Platform to
                            potential business partners in aggregated or de-identified form
                            that can’t reasonably be used to identify you; and
                        </li>
<li>
                            Whenever you consent to the sharing.
                        </li>

                    commercial or promotional emails but we will still send you transactional
                    and relational emails about your account use of the Lyft Platform.
                


**Text Messages**. You can opt out of receiving commercial or
                    promotional text messages by texting the word END to 46080 from the mobile
                    device receiving the messages.  You may also opt out of receiving all
                    texts from Lyft (including transactional or relational messages) by
                    texting the word STOPALL to 46080 from the mobile device receiving the
                    messages, however, opting out of receiving all texts may impact your use
                    of the Lyft Platform.  Drivers can also opt out of driver-specific
                    messages by texting STOP in response to a driver SMS.  To re-enable texts
                    you can text START in response to an unsubscribe confirmation SMS.
                


**Push Notifications**.  You can opt out of receiving push
                    notifications through your device settings.  Please note that opting out
                    of receiving push notifications may impact your use of the Lyft Platform
                    (such as receiving a notification that your ride has arrived).
                


**Profile Information**. While your name will always be
                    shared with Drivers and fellow Lyft Line Riders, you can delete any
                    additional information that you added to your Profile at any time if you
                    don’t want Drivers and Lyft Line Riders to see it. Riders will always be
                    able to see Drivers’ names, rating, profile photos, and vehicle
                    information.
                


**Location Information**. While you can prevent your device
                    from sharing location information at any time through your Device’s
                    operating system settings, Rider and Driver location is core to the Lyft
                    Platform and without it we can’t provide our services to you.
                


**Facebook Friends**. You can control whether to enable or
                    disable the Facebook mutual friends feature through your profile settings.
                


**Editing and Accessing Your Information**. You can review
                    and edit certain account information by logging in to your account
                    settings and profile (Drivers may edit additional information through the
                    Driver portal). If would like to terminate your Lyft account, please
                    contact us through our <a href="https://help.lyft.com/">Help
                    Center</a> with your request. If you choose to terminate your account, we
                    will deactivate it for you but may retain information from your account
                    for a certain period of time and disclose it in a manner consistent with
                    our practices under this Privacy Policy for accounts that are not closed.
                    We also may retain information from your account to collect any fees owed,
                    resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, analyze usage of the Lyft
                    Platform, assist with any investigations, prevent fraud, enforce our Terms
                    of Service, or take other actions as required or permitted by law.

**Data Security**.  We are committed to protecting the data
                    of the Lyft community. Even though we take reasonable precautions to
                    protect your data, no security measures can be 100% secure, and we cannot
                    guarantee the security of your data.
                


**Children’s Privacy**.  Lyft is not directed to children,

                    information, we will take steps to delete that information. If you believe
                    that a child under the age of 13 has given us personal information, please

                    communication. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy periodically
                    to stay up-to-date about our privacy practices. As long as you use the
                    Lyft Platform, you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy and any updates we
