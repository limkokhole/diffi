<h1>Lyft Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Last Updated: November 27, 2019</p>
<p>
                    These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement (the âAgreementâ)
                    between you and Lyft, Inc., its parents, subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates,
                    officers and directors (collectively, âLyft,â âwe,â âusâ or âourâ) governing your use
                    of the Lyft application, website, and technology platform (collectively, the âLyft
                    Platformâ).
                </p>
<p class="uppercase">
                    Please be advised: This Agreement contains provisions that govern how claims between
                    you and Lyft can be brought
                    (<a href="#tos-dispute-resolution-and-arbitration-agreement">see Section 17 below</a>).
                    These provisions will, with limited exception, require you to submit claims you
                    have against Lyft to binding and final arbitration on an individual basis, not as a
                    plaintiff or class member in any class, group or representative action or
                    proceeding. As a Driver or Driver applicant, you have an opportunity to opt out of
                    arbitration with respect to certain claims as provided in Section 17.
                </p>
<p>
                    By entering into this Agreement, and/or by using or accessing the Lyft Platform
                    you expressly acknowledge that you understand this Agreement (including the dispute
                    resolution and arbitration provisions in Section 17) and accept all of its terms.
                    <span class="uppercase">If you do not agree to be bound by the terms and
                    conditions of this Agreement, you may not use or access the Lyft Platform or any of
                    the services provided through the Lyft Platform.</span> If you use the Lyft Platform
                    in another country, you agree to be subject to Lyft's terms of service for that country.
                </p>

<h2>The Lyft Platform</h2>
<p>
                    The Lyft Platform provides a marketplace where persons who seek transportation to
                    certain destinations (âRidersâ) can be matched with transportation options to such
                    destinations. One option for Riders is to request a ride from rideshare drivers who
                    are driving to or through those destinations (âDriversâ). Drivers and Riders are
                    collectively referred to herein as âUsers,â and the driving services provided by
                    Drivers to Riders shall be referred to herein as "Rideshare Services." As a User,
                    you authorize Lyft to match you with a Driver or Rider based on factors such as
                    your location, the estimated time to pickup, your destination, user preferences, and
                    platform efficiency, and to cancel an existing match and rematch based on the same
                    considerations. Any decision by a User to offer or accept Rideshare Services is a
                    decision made in such Userâs sole discretion. Each Rideshare Service provided by a
                    Driver to a Rider shall constitute a separate agreement between such persons.
                </p>
<p>
                    In certain markets, Riders may have the option to rent bikes or scooters through the
                    Lyft Platform to ride to their destination. In some markets these bikes and scooters
                    are owned by Lyft. In other markets Lyft operates a bike-share or scooter-share
                    program on behalf of third parties. In either case, your rental and use of bikes and
                    scooters through the Lyft Platform is subject to additional agreements between you and
                    Lyft and third parties as applicable to the particular market ("Supplemental Agreements").
                    Please review any applicable Supplemental Agreements carefully. <span class="uppercase">If
                    you do not agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of a supplemental agreement,
                    you may not rent or use the bikes or scooters in such market.</span> In the event of
                    any conflict between this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any Supplemental
                    Agreement, the terms of this agreement shall control.
                    </p>

<section id="tos-modification-to-the-agreement">
<h2>Modification to the Agreement</h2>
<p>
                    Lyft reserves the right to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such
                    modifications shall be binding on you only upon your acceptance of the modified
                    Agreement. Lyft reserves the right to modify any information on pages referenced in
                    the hyperlinks from this Agreement from time to time, and such modifications shall
                    become effective upon posting. Continued use of the Lyft Platform or Rideshare Services
                    after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. Unless material
                    changes are made to the arbitration provisions herein, you agree that modification
                    of this Agreement does not create a renewed opportunity to opt out of arbitration
                    (if applicable).
                </p>

<section id="tos-eligibility">
<h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p>
                    The Lyft Platform may only be used by individuals who have the right and
                    authority to enter into this Agreement, are fully able and competent to satisfy
                    the terms, conditions, and obligations herein. The Lyft Platform is not
                    available to Users who have had their User account temporarily or permanently
                    deactivated. You may not allow other persons to use your User account, and you
                    agree that you are the sole authorized user of your account. To use the Lyft
                    Platform, each User shall create a User account. Each person may only create
                    one User account, and Lyft reserves the right to deactivate any additional or
                    duplicate accounts.
                </p>
<p>
                    By becoming a User, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years
                    old.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are the parent or legal guardian of
                    a 16 or 17-year old minor you may create a Lyft account for such minor to use
                    the Lyft Platform subject to the following requirements and restrictions: (a)
                    you ensure that the minorâs use of the Lyft Platform is limited solely to
                    accessing and using bike-share or scooter-share services where expressly
                    permitted under the Supplemental Agreement applicable to such services, (b) you
                    ensure that the minorâs use of the Lyft Platform and applicable bike-share or
                    scooter-share services is done in compliance and acknowledgement of all
                    applicable safety instructions and warnings in this Agreement, any applicable
                    Supplemental Agreements, and the Lyft App, (c) you ensure that the minor does
                    not request or accept any Rideshare Services unless accompanied by you or an
                    authorized guardian, and (d) you expressly guarantee the minorâs acceptance of
                    the terms of this Agreement. You will be responsible for any breach of the above
                    representations, warranties and/or this Agreement, and/or any attempt of the
                    minor to disaffirm this Agreement. Furthermore, you hereby represent that you
                    are fully authorized to execute this Agreement on behalf of yourself and all
                    other parents or legal guardians of the minor rider.
                </p>
<p>
                    By creating a Lyft account for such minor, you hereby give permission and consent to
                    the Agreement on the minorâs behalf, and you shall assume any and all responsibility
                    and liability for the minor's use of the Lyft Platform as provided by the terms of this
                    Agreement and any applicable Supplemental Agreements. You will be responsible for any
                    breach of the above representations, warranties and/or this Agreement, and/or any
                    attempt of the minor to disaffirm this Agreement. Furthermore, you hereby represent
                    that you are fully authorized to execute this Agreement on behalf of yourself and
                    all other parents or legal guardians of the minor rider.

<section id="tos-charges">
<h2>Charges</h2>
<p>
                    As a rider, you understand that request or use of Rideshare Services may result
                    in  charges to you (âChargesâ). Charges related to bikes and scooters are
                    addressed in  the applicable Supplemental Agreement. Charges for Rideshare
                    Services include Fares  and other applicable fees, tolls, surcharges, and taxes
                    as set forth on your marketâs Lyft Cities page (<a href="https://www.lyft.com/cities">www.lyft.com/cities</a>), plus any tips to
                    the  Driver that you elect to pay. Lyft has the authority and reserves the right
                    to  determine and modify pricing by posting applicable pricing terms to your
                    marketâs  Lyft Cities page or quoting you a price for a specific ride at the
                    time you make a  request. Pricing may vary based on the type of service you
                    request (e.g., shared,  economy, extra seats, luxury) as described on your
                    marketâs Lyft Cities page. You are  responsible for reviewing the applicable
                    Lyft Cities page or price quote within the  Lyft app and shall be responsible
                    for all Charges incurred under your User account  regardless of your awareness
                    of such Charges or the amounts thereof.
                </p>
<p>
                    Fares. There are two types of fares, variable and quoted.
                </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Variable Fares</strong>. Variable fares consist of a base charge and
                        incremental charges based on the duration and distance of your ride. For
                        particularly short rides, minimum fares may apply. Please note that we use GPS
                        data from your Driverâs phone to calculate the distance traveled on your ride.
                        We cannot guarantee the availability or accuracy of GPS data. If we lose signal
                        we will calculate time and distance using available data from your ride.
                    </li>
<li>
<strong>Quoted Fares</strong>. In some cases Lyft may quote you a Fare at the
                        time of your request. The quote is subject to change until the ride request is
                        confirmed. If during your ride you change your destination, make multiple
                        stops, or attempt to abuse the Lyft Platform, we may cancel the fare quote and
                        charge you a variable fare based on the time and distance of your ride. Lyft
                        does not guarantee that the quoted fare price will be equal to a variable fare
                        for the same ride. Quoted Fares may include the Fees and Other Charges below,
                        as applicable.
                    </li>
</ul>
<p>
                    Fees and Other Charges.
                </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Service Fee</strong>. You may be charged a âService Feeâ for each ride
                        as set forth on the applicable Lyft Cities page.
                    </li>
<li>
<strong>Prime Time</strong>. At times of high demand for Rideshare Services
                        ("Prime Timeâ) you acknowledge that Charges may increase substantially. For all
                        rides with a variable fare, we will use reasonable efforts to inform you of any Prime
                        Time multipliers in effect at the time of your request. For quoted fares we may
                        factor in the Prime Time multiplier into the quoted price of the ride.
                    </li>
<li>
<strong>Cancellation Fee</strong>. After requesting a ride you may cancel it
                        through the app, but note that in certain cases a cancellation fee may apply.
                        You may also be charged if you fail to show up after requesting a ride. Please
                        check out our Help Center to learn more about
                        <a href="https://help.lyft.com/hc/articles/115012922687-Cancellation-policy-for-passengers">
                        Lyftâs cancellation policy</a>, including applicable fees.
                    </li>
<li>
<strong>Damage Fee</strong>. If a Driver reports that you have materially
                        damaged the Driver's vehicle, you agree to pay a âDamage Feeâ of up to $250
                        depending on the extent of the damage (as determined by Lyft in its sole
                        discretion), towards vehicle repair or cleaning. Lyft reserves the right (but
                        is not obligated) to verify or otherwise require documentation of damages prior
                        to processing the Damage Fee.
                    </li>
<li>
<strong>Tolls</strong>. In some instances tolls (or return tolls) may apply to
                        your ride. Please see our Help Center and your marketâs Lyft Cities page for
                        more <a href="https://help.lyft.com/hc/articles/115012927787-Toll-info-for-passengers">
                        information about toll charges</a> and a list of applicable
                        <a href="https://help.lyft.com/hc/articles/213815078-List-of-Tolls">tolls
                        and return charges</a>. We do not guarantee that the amount charged by Lyft
                        will match the toll charged to the Driver, if any.
                    </li>
<li>
<strong>Other Charges</strong>. Other fee and surcharges may apply to your
                        ride, including: actual or anticipated airport fees, state or local fees, or
                        event fees as determined by Lyft or its marketing partners. In addition, where
                        required by law Lyft will collect applicable taxes. See your market's
                        Lyft Cities page for details on other Charges that may apply to your ride.
                    </li>
<li>
<strong>Tips</strong>. Following a ride, you may elect to tip your Driver in
                        cash or through the Lyft application. You may also elect to set a default tip
                        amount or percentage through the app; Any tips will be provided entirely to the
                        applicable Driver.

                    General.

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Facilitation of Charges</strong>. All Charges are facilitated through a
                        third-party payment processor (e.g., First Data, Stripe, Inc., or Braintree, a
                        division of PayPal, Inc.). Lyft may replace its third-party payment processor
                        without notice to you. Charges shall only be made through the Lyft
                        Platform. With the exception of tips, cash payments are strictly prohibited.
                        Your payment of Charges to Lyft satisfies your payment obligation for your use
                        of the Lyft Platform and Rideshare Services. Lyft may group multiple charges
                        into a single aggregate transaction on your payment method based on the date(s)
                        they were incurred. If you don't recognize a transaction, then check your ride
                        receipts and payment history.
                    </li>
<li>
<strong>No Refunds</strong>. All Charges are non-refundable. This no-refund
                        policy shall apply at all times regardless of your decision to terminate usage
                        of the Lyft Platform, any disruption to the Lyft Platform or Rideshare Services,
                        or any other reason whatsoever.
                    </li>
<li>
<strong>Coupons</strong>. You may receive coupons that you can apply toward
                        payment of certain Charges upon completion of a Ride. Coupons are only valid
                        for use on the Lyft Platform, and are not transferable or redeemable for cash
                        except as required by law.  Coupons cannot be combined, and if the cost of your
                        ride exceeds the applicable credit or discount value we will charge your
                        payment method on file for the outstanding cost of the Ride. For quoted or
                        variable fares, Lyft may deduct the amount attributable to the Service Fee,
                        Tolls, or Other Charges before application of the coupon. Additional
                        restrictions on coupons may apply as communicated to you in a relevant
                        promotion or by clicking on the relevant coupon within the Promotions
                        section of the Lyft App.
                    </li>
<li>
<strong>Credit Card Authorization</strong>. Upon addition of a new payment
                        method or each ride request, Lyft may seek authorization of your selected
                        payment method to verify the payment method, ensure the ride cost will be
                        covered, and protect against unauthorized behavior. The authorization is not a
                        charge, however, it may reduce your available credit by the authorization
                        amount until your bankâs next processing cycle. Should the amount of our
                        authorization exceed the total funds on deposit in your account, you may be
                        subject to overdraft of NSF charges by the bank issuing your debit or prepaid
                        card. We cannot be held responsible for these charges and are unable to assist
                        you in recovering them from your issuing bank. Check out our Help Center to

                    subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, a limited,
                    revocable, non-exclusive license to display and use the Lyft Marks solely on the

                    directly to you in connection with providing the Rideshare Services ("License").
                    The License is non-transferable and non-assignable, and you shall not grant to any

                    used in any manner that is likely to cause confusion, including but not limited
                    to: use of a Lyft Mark in a domain name or Lyft referral code, or use of a Lyft

                    or banner. You may identify yourself as a Driver on the Lyft Platform, but may
                    not misidentify yourself as Lyft, an employee of Lyft, or a representative of Lyft.

                    You acknowledge that Lyft is the owner and licensor of the Lyft Marks, including
                    all goodwill associated therewith, and that your use of the Lyft logo
                    (or any Lyft Marks) will confer no interest in or ownership of the Lyft Marks in you
                    but rather inures to the benefit of Lyft. You agree to use the Lyft logo strictly in
                    accordance with Lyftâs Trademark Usage Guidelines, as may be provided to you and revised
                    from time to time, and to immediately cease any use that Lyft determines to nonconforming

                    with the terms, conditions and restrictions herein; (3) take any other action that
                    would jeopardize or impair Lyftâs rights as owner of the Lyft Marks or the legality
                    and/or enforceability of the Lyft Marks, including, challenging or opposing Lyftâs
                    ownership in the Lyft Marks; (4) apply for trademark registration or renewal of

                    Violation of any provision of this License may result in immediate termination of
                    the License, in Lyftâs sole discretion, a takedown request sent to the appropriate

<h2>Disclaimers</h2>
<p>
                    The following disclaimers are made on behalf of Lyft, our affiliates, subsidiaries,

                </p>
<p>
                    Lyft does not provide transportation services, and Lyft is not a transportation
                    carrier. Lyft is not a common carrier or public carrier. It is up to the Driver to
                    decide whether or not to offer a ride to a Rider contacted through the Lyft
                    Platform, and it is up to the Rider to decide whether or not to accept a ride from
                    any Driver contacted through the Lyft Platform. We cannot ensure that a Driver or
                    Rider will complete an arranged transportation service. We have no control over the
                    quality or safety of the transportation that occurs as a result of the Rideshare

<p>
                    The Lyft Platform is provided on an âas isâ basis and without any warranty or
                    condition, express, implied or statutory. We do not guarantee and do not promise
                    any specific results from use of the Lyft Platform and/or the Rideshare Services,
                    including the ability to provide or receive Rideshare Services at any given location
                    or time. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we specifically disclaim any
                    implied warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and
                    non-infringement. Some states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so
                    the foregoing disclaimer may not apply to you.
                </p>
<p>
                    We do not warrant that your use of the Lyft Platform or Rideshare Services will be
                    accurate, complete, reliable, current, secure, uninterrupted, always available, or
                    error- free, or will meet your requirements, that any defects in the Lyft Platform
                    will be corrected, or that the Lyft Platform is free of viruses or other harmful
                    components. We disclaim liability for, and no warranty is made with respect to,
                    connectivity and availability of the Lyft Platform or Rideshare Services.

<p>
                    We cannot guarantee that each Rider is who he or she claims to be. Please use
                    common sense when using the Lyft Platform and Rideshare Services, including looking
                    at the photos of the Driver or Rider you have matched with to make sure it is the
                    same individual you see in person. Please note that there are also risks of dealing
                    with underage persons or people acting under false pretense, and we do not accept
                    responsibility or liability for any content, communication or other use or access
                    of the Lyft Platform by persons under the age of 18 in violation of this Agreement.
                    We encourage you to communicate directly with each potential Driver or Rider prior
                    to engaging in an arranged transportation service.

                    you post on the Lyft Platform or through the Rideshare Services or release to others.
                    We disclaim all liability, regardless of the form of action, for the acts or omissions
                    of other Users (including unauthorized users, or âhackersâ).

                    In no event will Lyft, including our affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, successors
                    and assigns, and each of our respective officers, directors, employees, agents, or
                    shareholders (collectively âLyftâ for purposes of this section), be liable to you
                    for any incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, consequential, or indirect
                    damages (including damages for deletion, corruption, loss of data, loss of
                    programs, failure to store any information or other content maintained or
                    transmitted by the Lyft Platform, service interruptions, or for the cost of
                    procurement of substitute services) arising out of or in connection with the Lyft
                    Platform, the Rideshare Services, or this Agreement, however arising including
                    negligence, even if we or our agents or representatives know or have been advised
                    of the possibility of such damages. The Lyft Platform may be used by you to request
                    and schedule transportation, goods, or other services with third party providers,
                    but you agree that Lyft has no responsibility or liability to you related to any
                    transportation, goods or other services provided to you by third party providers
                    other than as expressly set forth in this agreement. Certain jurisdictions may not
                    allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. If these laws apply to you,
                    some or all of the above disclaimers, exclusions or limitations may not apply to
                    you, and you may have additional rights.

<h2>Term and Termination</h2>
<p>
                    This Agreement is effective upon your creation of a User account. This
                    Agreement may be terminated: a) by User, without cause, upon seven (7) daysâ
                    prior written notice to Lyft; or b) by either Party immediately, without
                    notice, upon the other Partyâs material breach of this Agreement, including but
                    not limited to any breach of Section 9 or breach of Section 10(a) through (i)
                    of this Agreement. In addition, Lyft may terminate this Agreement or deactivate
                    your User account immediately in the event: (1) you no longer qualify to
                    provide Rideshare Services or to operate the approved vehicle under applicable
                    law, rule, permit, ordinance or regulation; (2) you fall below Lyftâs star rating
                    or cancellation threshold; (3) Lyft has the good faith belief that such action is
                    necessary to protect the safety of the Lyft community or third parties,
                    provided that in the event of a deactivation pursuant to (1)-(3) above, you
                    will be given notice of the potential or actual deactivation and an opportunity
                    to attempt to cure the issue to Lyftâs reasonable satisfaction prior to Lyft
                    permanently terminating the Agreement. For all other breaches of this
                    Agreement, you will be provided notice and an opportunity to cure the breach.
                    If the breach is cured in a timely manner and to Lyftâs satisfaction, this
                    Agreement will not be permanently terminated. Sections 2, 6, 7 (with respect to
                    the license), 11-12, 14-19, and 21 shall survive any termination or expiration
                    of this Agreement.

                    provided below.
                </p>
<p>
<span class="uppercase">By agreeing to arbitration, you understand that you and
                    Lyft are waiving the right to sue in court or have a jury trial for all Claims,
                    except as expressly otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.</span>
                    This Arbitration Agreement is intended to require arbitration of every claim or
                    dispute that can lawfully be arbitrated, except for those claims and disputes
                    which by the terms of this Arbitration Agreement are expressly excluded from
                    the requirement to arbitrate.
                </p>
<h5>
                    (b) Prohibition of Class Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.
                </h5>
<p class="uppercase">
                    You understand and agree that you and Lyft may each bring Claims in arbitration
                    against the other only in an individual capacity and not on a class, collective
                    action, or representative basis (âClass Action Waiverâ).  You understand and
                    agree that you and Lyft both are waiving the right to pursue or have a dispute
                    resolved as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective or
                    representative proceeding.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this subsection (b)
                    shall not apply to representative private attorneys general act claims brought
                    against Lyft, which are addressed separately in Section 17(c).
                </p>
<p>
                    The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue
                    any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. The arbitrator shall have
                    no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on a class,
                    collective, or representative basis. The arbitrator may award declaratory or
                    injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to
                    the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claims.
                </p>
<p>
                    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement
                    or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability,
                    revocability or validity of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a
                    civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in
                    which: (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action
                    and (2) there is a final judicial determination that the Class Action Waiver is
                    unenforceable with respect to any Claim or any particular remedy for a Claim
                    (such as a request for public injunctive relief), then that Claim or particular
                    remedy (and only that Claim or particular remedy) shall be severed from any
                    remaining claims and/or remedies and may be brought in a civil court of
                    competent jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver shall be enforced in
                    arbitration on an individual basis as to all other Claims or remedies to the
                    fullest extent possible.
                </p>
<h5>
                    (c) Representative PAGA Waiver.
                </h5>
<p>
                    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Arbitration
                    Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law: (1) you and Lyft agree not
                    to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the Private
                    Attorneys General Act of 2004 (âPAGAâ), California Labor Code Â§ 2698 et seq.,
                    in any court or in arbitration, and (2) for any claim brought on a private
                    attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, both you and Lyft
                    agree that any such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual
                    basis only (i.e., to resolve whether you have personally been aggrieved or
                    subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to
                    resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective
                    proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or
                    subject to any violations of law) (collectively, ârepresentative PAGA Waiverâ).
                    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration
                    Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability,
                    enforceability, revocability or validity of this representative PAGA Waiver may
                    be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an
                    arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be
                    unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the unenforceable provision shall
                    be severed from this Agreement; (ii) severance of the unenforceable provision
                    shall have no impact whatsoever on the Arbitration Agreement or the requirement
                    that any remaining Claims be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the
                    Arbitration Agreement; and (iii) any such representative PAGA or other
                    representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a
                    civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent
                    that there are any Claims to be litigated in a civil court of competent
                    jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that
                    the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those Claims,
                    the Parties agree that litigation of those Claims shall be stayed pending the
                    outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration.
                </p>
<h5>
                    (d) Rules Governing the Arbitration.
                </h5>
<p>
                    Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement shall be
                    administered by the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) pursuant to its
                    <a href="https://www.adr.org/Rules">Consumer Arbitration Rules</a> 
                    that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, as modified by the terms set forth in this Agreement. 
                    Copies of these rules can be obtained at the AAAâs website (www.adr.org) (the âAAA
                    Rulesâ) or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
                    if requested by you and if proper based on the facts and circumstances of the
                    Claims presented, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select a
                    different set of AAA Rules, but in no event shall the arbitrator consolidate
                    more than one personâs Claims, or otherwise preside over any form of
                    representative, collective, or class proceeding. The parties may select a
                    different arbitration administrator upon mutual written agreement.
                </p>
<p>
                    As part of the arbitration, both you and Lyft will have the opportunity for
                    reasonable discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the
                    Claim. The arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be
                    available in court. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief
                    only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
                    necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claims. The
                    arbitrator will provide a reasoned written statement of the arbitratorâs
                    decision which shall explain the award given and the findings and conclusions
                    on which the decision is based.
                </p>
<p>
                    The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with
                    applicable law, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The
                    arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving
                    different Riders or Drivers, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations
                    involving the same Rider or Driver to the extent required by applicable law.
                    The arbitratorâs award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award
                    rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
                    thereof, provided that any award may be challenged in a court of competent
                    jurisdiction.

<h5>
                    (e) Arbitration Fees and Awards.
                </h5>
<p>
                    The payment of filing and arbitration fees will be governed by the relevant AAA
                    Rules subject to the following modifications:
                </p>
<ol>
<li>
                        If Lyft initiates arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, Lyft will
                        pay all AAA filing and arbitration fees.
                    </li>
<li>
                        With respect to any Claims brought by Lyft against a Driver, or for Claims
                        brought by a Driver against Lyft that: (A) are based on an alleged employment
                        relationship between Lyft and a Driver; (B) arise out of, or relate to, Lyftâs
                        actual deactivation of a Driverâs User account or a threat by Lyft to
                        deactivate a Driverâs User account; (C) arise out of, or relate to, Lyftâs
                        actual termination of a Driverâs Agreement with Lyft under the termination
                        provisions of this Agreement, or a threat by Lyft to terminate a Driverâs
                        Agreement; (D) arise out of, or relate to, Fares (as defined in this Agreement,
                        including Lyftâs commission or fees on the Fares), tips, or average hourly
                        guarantees owed by Lyft to Drivers for Rideshare Services, other than disputes
                        relating to referral bonuses, other Lyft promotions, or consumer-type disputes,
                        or (E) arise out of or relate to background checks performed in connection with
                        a user seeking to become a Driver (the subset of Claims in subsections (A)-(E)
                        shall be collectively referred to as âDriver Claimsâ), Lyft shall pay all costs
                        unique to arbitration (as compared to the costs of adjudicating the same claims
                        before a court), including the regular and customary arbitration fees and
                        expenses (to the extent not paid by Lyft pursuant to the fee provisions above).
                        However, if you are the party initiating the Driver Claim, you shall be
                        responsible for contributing up to an amount equal to the filing fee that would
                        be paid to initiate the claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state
                        in which you provide Rideshare Services to Riders, unless a lower fee amount would
                        be owed by you pursuant to the AAA Rules, applicable law, or subsection (e)(1)
                        above.  Any dispute as to whether a cost is unique to arbitration shall be
                        resolved by the arbitrator. For purposes of this Section 17(e)(3), the term
                        âDriverâ shall be deemed to include both Drivers and Driver applicants who have
                        not been approved to drive.
                    </li>
<li>
                        Except as provided in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 or any state
                        equivalents, each party shall pay its own attorneysâ fees and pay any costs
                        that are not unique to the arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would
                        incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a court such as costs to subpoena
                        witnesses and/or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition
                        transcripts, copy documents, etc.).
                    </li>
<li>
                        At the end of any arbitration, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees and
                        costs or any portion thereof to you if you prevail, to the extent
                        authorized by applicable law.
                    </li>
<li>
                        Although under some laws Lyft may have a right to an award of attorneys'
                        fees and non-filing fee expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, Lyft
                        agrees that it will not seek such an award unless you are represented by an
                        attorney or the arbitrator has determined that the claim is frivolous or
                        brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards of Federal Rule
                        of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
                    </li>
<li>
                        If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of
                        Lyftâs last written settlement offer made after you participated in good
                        faith in the optional Negotiation process described in subsection (k)
                        below, then Lyft will pay you the amount of the award or U.S. $1,000,
                        whichever is greater.
                    </li>

<h5>
                    (f) Location and Manner of Arbitration.
                </h5>
<p>
                    Unless you and Lyft agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings between Lyft and
                    a Rider will take place in the county of your billing address, and any
                    arbitration hearings between Lyft and a Driver will take place in the county in
                    which the Driver provides Rideshare Services. If AAA arbitration is unavailable
                    in your county, the arbitration hearings will take place in the nearest available
                    location for a AAA arbitration. Your right to a hearing will be determined by the
                    AAA Rules.
                </p>
<h5>
                    (g) Exceptions to Arbitration.
                </h5>
<p>
                    This Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following types of
                    claims: (1) small claims actions brought on an individual basis that are within the
                    scope of such small claims courtâs jurisdiction; (2) a representative action
                    brought on behalf of others under PAGA or other private attorneys general acts, to
                    the extent the representative PAGA Waiver in Section 17(c) of such action is deemed
                    unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction under applicable law not
                    preempted by the FAA; (3) claims for workersâ compensation, state disability
                    insurance and unemployment insurance benefits; (4) claims that may not be
                    subject to arbitration as a matter of generally applicable law not preempted by the
                    FAA; and (5) individual claims of sexual assault or sexual harassment in connection
                    with the use of the Lyft Platform or Rideshare Services. Where these claims are
                    brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, Lyft will not require arbitration of
                    those claims. Lyft's agreement not to require arbitration of these claims does not
                    waive the enforceability of any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement
                    (including without limitation the waivers provided in Section 17(b)), or of the
                    enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement as to any other dispute, claim, or
                    controversy.

                </p>
<p>
                    Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prevents you from making a report to or
                    filing a claim or charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S.
                    Department of Labor, Securities Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board
                    (âNLRBâ), or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, or similar local,
                    state or federal agency, and nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed
                    to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any
                    agency in order to fulfill the party's obligation to exhaust administrative
                    remedies before making a claim in arbitration  However, should you bring an
                    administrative claim, you may only seek or recover money damages of any type
                    pursuant to this Arbitration Provision, and you knowingly and voluntarily waive the
                    right to seek or recover money damages of any type pursuant to any administrative
                    complaint, except for a complaint issued by the NLRB.  Should you participate in an
                    NLRB proceeding, you may only recover money damages if such recovery does not arise
                    from or relate to a claim previously adjudicated under this Arbitration Provision
                    or settled by you.  Similarly, you may not recover money damages under this
                    Arbitration Provision if you have already adjudicated such claim with the NLRB.
                    Nothing in this Agreement or Arbitration Agreement prevents your participation in
                    an investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise
                    covered by this Arbitration Provision.
                </p>
<h5>
                    (h) Severability.
                </h5>
<p>
                    In addition to the severability provisions in subsections (b) and (c) above, in
                    the event  that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or
                    unenforceable  under applicable law not preempted by the FAA, such provision
                    shall be severed and  the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given
                    full force and effect.
                </p>
<h5>
                    (i) Driver Claims in Pending Settlement.
                </h5>
<p>
                    If you are a member of a putative class in a lawsuit against Lyft involving
                    Driver Claims and a Motion for Preliminary Approval of a Settlement has been
                    filed with the court in that lawsuit prior to this Agreementâs effective date
                    (a âPending Settlement Actionâ), then this Arbitration Agreement shall not
                    apply to your Driver Claims in that particular class action. Instead, your
                    Driver Claims in that Pending Settlement Action shall continue to be governed
                    by the arbitration provisions contained in the applicable Agreement that you
                    accepted prior to this Agreementâs effective date.

<h5>
                    (j)  Opting Out of Arbitration for Driver Claims That Are Not In a Pending
                    Settlement Action.
                </h5>
<p>
                    As a Driver or Driver applicant, you may opt out of the requirement to arbitrate
                    Driver Claims defined in Section 17(e)(3) (except as limited by Section 17(i)
                    above) pursuant to the terms of this subsection if you have not previously
                    agreed to an arbitration provision in Lyftâs Terms of Service where you had the
                    opportunity to opt out of the requirement to arbitrate. If you have previously
                    agreed to such an arbitration provision, you may opt out of any revisions to
                    your prior arbitration agreement made by this provision in the manner specified
                    below, but opting out of this arbitration provision has no effect on any
                    previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with Lyft.
                    If you have not previously agreed to such an arbitration provision and do not
                    wish to be subject to this Arbitration Agreement with respect to Driver Claims,
                    you may opt out of arbitration with respect to such Driver Claims, other than
                    those in a Pending Settlement Action, by notifying Lyft in writing of your
                    desire to opt out of arbitration for such Driver Claims, which writing must be
                    dated, signed and delivered by electronic mail to arbitrationoptout@lyft.com.
                </p>
<p>
                    In order to be effective, (A) the writing must clearly indicate your intent to
                    opt out of this Arbitration Agreement with respect to Driver Claims that are
                    not part of a Pending Settlement Action, (B) the writing must include the name,
                    phone number, and email address associated with your User Account, and (C) the
                    email containing the signed writing must be sent within 30 days of  the date
                    this Agreement is executed by you. Should you not opt out within the  30-day
                    period, you and Lyft shall be bound by the terms of this Arbitration  Agreement
                    in full (including with respect to Driver Claims that are not part of  a Pending
                    Settlement Action). As provided in paragraph 17(i) above, any opt out  that you
                    submit shall not apply to any Driver Claims that are part of a Pending
                    Settlement Action and your Driver Claims in any such Pending Settlement Action
                    shall continue to be governed by the arbitration provisions that are contained
                    in the applicable Lyft Terms of Use that you agreed to prior to the effective
                    date of this Agreement.
                </p>
<p>
                    Cases have been filed against Lyft and may be filed in the future involving
                    Driver Claims. You should assume that there are now, and may be in the future,
                    lawsuits against Lyft alleging class, collective, and/or representative Driver
                    Claims in which the plaintiffs seek to act on your behalf, and which, if
                    successful, could result in some monetary recovery to you. But if you do agree
                    to arbitration of Driver Claims with Lyft under this Arbitration Agreement, you
                    are agreeing in advance that you will bring all such claims, and seek all
                    monetary and other relief, against Lyft in an individual arbitration,  except
                    for the Driver Claims that are part of a Pending Settlement Action. You  are
                    also agreeing in advance that you will not participate in, or seek to  recover
                    monetary or other relief, for such claims in any court action or class,
                    collective, and/or representative action. You have the right to consult with
                    counsel of your choice concerning this Arbitration Agreement and you will not
                    be subject to retaliation if you exercise your right to assert claims or opt-
                    out of any Driver Claims under this Arbitration Agreement.

<h5>
                    (k) Optional Pre-Arbitration Negotiation Process.
                </h5>
<p>
                    Before initiating any arbitration or proceeding, you and Lyft may agree to
                    first attempt to negotiate any dispute, claim or controversy between the
                    parties informally for 30 days, unless this time period is mutually extended by
                    you and Lyft. A party who intends to seek negotiation under this subsection
                    must first send to the other a written notice of the dispute (âNoticeâ). The
                    Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2)
                    set forth the specific relief sought. All offers, promises, conduct and
                    statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the negotiation by
                    any of the parties, their agents, employees, and attorneys are confidential,
                    privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including as evidence of liability
                    or for impeachment, in arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties,
                    provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not
                    be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the
                    negotiation.

<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
<p>
                    You agree not to use any technical, financial, strategic and other proprietary and
                    confidential information relating to Lyftâs business, operations and properties,
                    information about a User made available to you in connection with such Userâs use
                    of the Platform, which may include the Userâs name, pick-up location, contact
                    information and photo (âConfidential Informationâ) disclosed to you by Lyft for
                    your own use or for any purpose other than as contemplated herein. You shall not
                    disclose or permit disclosure of any Confidential Information to third parties,
                    and you agree not to store separate and outside of the Lyft Platform any User
                    Information obtained from the Lyft Platform. As a Driver, you understand that some
                    of Rider Information you receive may be protected by federal and/or state
                    confidentiality laws, such as the Health Information Portability and Accountability
                    Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), governing the privacy and security of protected (patient)
                    health information. In the event that you know a Rider, you should not disclose
                    to anyone the identity of the Rider or the location that you picked up, or dropped
                    of the Rider as this could violate HIPAA. You understand that any violation of the
                    Agreement's confidentiality provisions may violate HIPAA or state confidentiality
                    laws and could result in civil or criminal penalties against you. You agree to
                    take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure
                    or use of Confidential Information of Lyft in order to prevent it from
                    falling into the public domain. Notwithstanding the above, you shall not have
                    liability to Lyft with regard to any Confidential Information which you can prove:
                    was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed by Lyft or has entered the
                    public domain through no fault of yours; was known to you, without restriction, at
                    the time of disclosure, as demonstrated by files in existence at the time of
                    disclosure; is disclosed with the prior written approval of Lyft; becomes known to
                    you, without restriction, from a source other than Lyft without breach of this
                    Agreement by you and otherwise not in violation of Lyftâs rights; or is disclosed
                    pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other
                    governmental body; provided, however, that You shall provide prompt notice of such
                    court order or requirement to Lyft to enable Lyft to seek a protective order or
                    otherwise prevent or restrict such disclosure.

<h2>Relationship with Lyft</h2>

                    As a Driver on the Lyft Platform, you acknowledge and agree that you and Lyft are
                    in a direct business relationship, and the relationship between the parties under
                    this Agreement is solely that of independent contracting parties.  You and Lyft

<h2>Other Services</h2>

                    In addition to connecting Riders with Drivers, the Lyft Platform may enable
                    Users to provide or receive services from other third parties. For
                    example, Users may be able to use the Lyft Platform to plan and reserve
                    rides on public transportation, take a ride in an autonomous vehicle
                    provided by a third party, rent vehicles, or obtain financial services

                    and that the Other Services are subject to the terms and pricing of the
                    third-party provider. If you choose to purchase Other Services through the

                    accessed through the Lyft Platform.

                    Except as provided in Section 17, this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of
                    the State of California without regard to choice of law principles. This choice of
                    law provision is only intended to specify the use of California law to interpret
                    this Agreement and is not intended to create any other substantive right to non-
                    Californians to assert claims under California law whether by statute, common law,
                    or otherwise.  If any provision of this Agreement is or becomes invalid or non-
                    binding, the parties shall remain bound by all other provisions of this Agreement.
                    In that event, the parties shall replace the invalid or non-binding provision with
                    provisions that are valid and binding and that have, to the  greatest extent
                    possible, a similar effect as the invalid or non-binding provision, given the
                    contents and purpose of this Agreement.  You agree that this Agreement and all
                    incorporated agreements may be automatically assigned by Lyft, in our sole
                    discretion by providing notice to you. Except as explicitly stated otherwise, any
                    notices to Lyft shall be given by certified mail, postage prepaid and return

                    94104. Any notices to you shall be provided to you through the Lyft Platform or
                    given to you via the email address or physical you provide to Lyft during the
                    registration process. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way

<h2>The Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
                    When you use the Lyft Platform, we collect the information you provide, usage information, and information about your
                    device. We also collect information about you from other sources like third party services, and optional programs in
                    which you participate, which we may combine with other information we have about you. Here are the types of information
                    we collect about you:
                </p>
<section id="privacy-information-you-provide-to-us">
<h3>A. Information You Provide to Us</h3>
<p>
<strong>Account Registration.</strong> When you create an account with Lyft, we collect the information you provide us,
                        such as your name, email address, phone number, birth date, and payment information. You may choose to share additional
                        info with us for your Rider profile, like your photo or saved addresses (e.g., home or work), and set up other
                        preferences (such as your preferred pronouns).
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Driver Information.</strong> If you apply to be a Driver, we will collect the information you provide in your
                        application, including your name, email address, phone number, birth date, profile photo, physical address, government
                        identification number (such as social security number), driverâs license information, vehicle information, and car
                        insurance information. We collect the payment information you provide us, including your bank routing numbers, and tax
                        information. Depending on where you want to drive, we may also ask for additional business license or permit
                        information. We may need additional information from you at some point after you become a Driver, including information
                        to confirm your identity (like a photo).
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Ratings and Feedback.</strong> When you rate and provide feedback about Riders or Drivers, we collect all of the
                        information you provide in your feedback.

<p>
<strong>Communications.</strong> When you contact us or we contact you, we collect any information that you provide,

<h3>B. Information We Collect When You Use the Lyft Platform</h3>
<p>
<strong>Location Information.</strong> Great rides start with an easy and accurate pickup. The Lyft Platform collects
                        location information (including GPS and WiFi data) differently depending on your Lyft app settings and device
                        permissions as well as whether you are using the platform as a Rider or Driver:
                    </p>
<ul>
<li>
                            Riders: We collect your deviceâs precise location when you open and use the Lyft app, including while the app is running
                            in the background from the time you request a ride until it ends. Lyft also tracks the precise location of scooters and
                            e-bikes at all times.
                        </li>
<li>
                            Drivers: We collect your deviceâs precise location when you open and use the app, including while the app is running in
                            the background when it is in driver mode. We also collect precise location for a limited time after you exit driver mode
                            in order to detect ride incidents, and continue collecting it until a reported or detected incident is no longer active.
                        </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Usage Information.</strong> We collect information about your use of the Lyft Platform, including ride
                        information like the date, time, destination, distance, route, payment, and whether you used a promotional or referral
                        code. We also collect information about your interactions with the Lyft Platform like our apps and websites, including
                        the pages and content you view and the dates and times of your use.
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Device Information.</strong> We collect information about the devices you use to access the Lyft Platform,
                        including device model, IP address, type of browser, version of operating system, identity of carrier and manufacturer,
                        radio type (such as 4G), preferences and settings (such as preferred language), application installations, device
                        identifiers, advertising identifiers, and push notification tokens. If you are a Driver, we also collect mobile sensor
                        data from your device (such as speed, direction, height, acceleration, deceleration, and other technical data).
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Communications Between Riders and Drivers.</strong> We work with a third party to facilitate phone calls and
                        text messages between Riders and Drivers without sharing either partyâs actual phone number with the other. But while we
                        use a third party to provide the communication service, we collect information about these communications, including the
                        participantsâ phone numbers, the date and time, and the contents of SMS messages. For security purposes, we may also
                        monitor or record the contents of phone calls made through the Lyft Platform, but we will always let you know we are
                        about to do so before the call begins.
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Address Book Contacts.</strong> You may set your device permissions to grant Lyft access to your contact lists
                        and direct Lyft to access your contact list, for example to help you refer friends to Lyft. If you do this, we will
                        access and store the names and contact information of the people in your address book.
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies, Analytics, and Third Party Technologies.</strong> We collect information through the use of âcookiesâ,
                        tracking pixels, data analytics tools like <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">Google
                        Analytics</a>, SDKs, and other third party technologies to understand how you navigate through the Lyft Platform and
                        interact with Lyft advertisements, to make your Lyft experience safer, to learn what content is popular, to improve your
                        site experience, to serve you better ads on other sites, and to save your preferences. Cookies are small text files that
                        web servers place on your device; they are designed to store basic information and to help websites and apps recognize
                        your browser. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your
                        browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be accessed every time you use the Lyft
                        Platform. You should consult your web browser(s) to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete or
                        choose not to accept cookies from us, you may miss out on certain features of the Lyft Platform.

<strong>Responding to Legal Proceedings and Requirements.</strong> Sometimes the law, government entities, or other

<h2>How We Share Your Information</h2>
<p>
                    We do not sell your personal information. To make the Lyft Platform work, we may need to share your personal information
                    with other users, third parties, and service providers. This section explains when and why we share your information.
                </p>
<section id="privacy-sharing-between-users">
<h3>A. Sharing Between Lyft Users</h3>
<p><strong>Riders and Drivers.</strong></p>
<p>
<em>Rider information shared with Driver:</em> Upon receiving a ride request, we share with the Driver the Riderâs
                        pickup location, name, profile photo, rating, Rider statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Rider),
                        and information the Rider includes in their Rider profile (like preferred pronouns). Upon pickup and during the ride, we
                        share with the Driver the Riderâs destination and any additional stops the Rider inputs into the Lyft app. Once the ride
                        is finished, we also eventually share the Riderâs rating and feedback with the Driver. (We remove the Riderâs identity
                        associated with ratings and feedback when we share it with Drivers, but a Driver may be able to identify the Rider that
                        provided the rating or feedback.)
                    </p>
<p>
<em>Driver information shared with Rider:</em> Upon a Driver accepting a requested ride, we will share with the Rider
                        the Driverâs name, profile photo, preferred pronouns, rating, real-time location, and the vehicle make, model, color,
                        and license plate, as well as other information in the Driverâs Lyft profile, such as information Drivers choose to add
                        (like country flag and why you drive) and Driver statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Driver).
                    </p>
<p>
                        Although we help Riders and Drivers communicate with one another to arrange a pickup, we do not share your actual phone
                        number or other contact information with other users. If you report a lost or found item to us, we will seek to connect
                        you with the relevant Rider or Driver, including sharing actual contact information with your consent.
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Shared Ride Riders.</strong> When Riders use a Lyft Shared ride, we share each Riderâs name and profile picture
                        to ensure safety. Riders may also see each otherâs pickup and drop-off locations as part of knowing the route while
                        sharing the ride.
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Rides Requested or Paid For by Others.</strong> Some rides you take may be requested or paid for by others. If
                        you take one of those rides using your Lyft Business Profile account, a code or coupon, a corporate credit card linked
                        to another account, or another user otherwise requests a ride for you, we may share some or all of your ride details
                        with that other party, including the date, time, charge, rating given, region of trip, and pick up and drop off location
                        of your ride.
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Referral Programs.</strong> If you refer someone to the Lyft Platform, we will let them know that you generated
                        the referral. If another user referred you, we may share information about your use of the Lyft Platform with that user.
                        For example, a referral source may receive a bonus when you join the Lyft Platform or complete a certain number of rides
                        and would receive such information.

<h2>How We Store and Protect Your Information</h2>

                    obligations. If you request account deletion, we will delete your information as set forth in the âDeleting Your

<h3>A. All Users</h3>
<p>
<strong>Email Subscriptions.</strong> You can always unsubscribe from our commercial or promotional emails by clicking
                        unsubscribe in those messages. We will still send you transactional and relational emails about your use of the Lyft
                        Platform.
                    </p>

                        END to 46080 from the mobile device receiving the messages. You may also opt out of receiving all texts from Lyft
                        (including transactional or relational messages) by texting the word STOPALL to 46080 from the mobile device receiving
                        the messages. Note that opting out of receiving all texts may impact your use of the Lyft Platform. Drivers can also opt
                        out of driver-specific messages by texting STOP in response to a driver SMS. To re-enable texts you can text START in
                        response to an unsubscribe confirmation SMS.

<strong>Push Notifications.</strong> You can opt out of receiving push notifications through your device settings.
                        Please note that opting out of receiving push notifications may impact your use of the Lyft Platform (such as receiving
                        a notification that your ride has arrived).
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Profile Information.</strong> You can review and edit certain account information you have chosen to add to your
                        profile by logging in to your account settings and profile.

<p>
<strong>Location Information.</strong> You can prevent your device from sharing location information through your
                        deviceâs system settings. But if you do, this may impact Lyftâs ability to provide you our full range of features and
                        services.

                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Do Not Track.</strong> Your browser may offer you a âDo Not Trackâ option, which allows you to signal to
                        operators of websites and web applications and services that you do not want them to track your online activities. The
