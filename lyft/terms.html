<h1>Lyft Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Last Updated: December 9, 2020</p>
<p>
                    These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement (the “Agreement”) between you and
                    Lyft, Inc., its parents, subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates, officers and directors
                    (collectively, “Lyft,” “we,” “us” or “our”) governing your use of the Lyft application (the “Lyft
                    App”), website, and technology platform (collectively, the “Lyft Platform”).

                </p>
<p class="uppercase">
                    Please be advised: This Agreement contains provisions that govern how claims between
                    you and Lyft can be brought
                    (<a href="#tos-dispute-resolution-and-arbitration-agreement">see Section 17 below</a>).
                    These provisions will, with limited exception, require you to submit claims you
                    have against Lyft to binding and final arbitration on an individual basis, not as a
                    plaintiff or class member in any class, group or representative action or
                    proceeding. As a Driver or Driver applicant, you have an opportunity to opt out of
                    arbitration with respect to certain claims as provided in Section 17.
                </p>
<p>
                    By entering into this Agreement, and/or by using or accessing the Lyft Platform
                    you expressly acknowledge that you understand this Agreement (including the dispute
                    resolution and arbitration provisions in Section 17) and accept all of its terms.
                    <span class="uppercase">If you do not agree to be bound by the terms and
                        conditions of this Agreement, you may not use or access the Lyft Platform or any of
                        the services provided through the Lyft Platform.</span> If you use the Lyft Platform
                    in another country, you agree to be subject to Lyft's terms of service for that country.
                </p>
<p>
                    When using the Lyft Platform, you also agree to conduct yourself in accordance with our <a href="https://www.lyft.com/safety/community-guidelines">Community
                        Guidelines</a>, which shall form part of this Agreement between you and Lyft.
                </p>

<h2>The Lyft Platform</h2>
<p>
                    The Lyft Platform provides a marketplace where, among other things, persons who seek transportation
                    to certain destinations (“Riders”) can be matched with transportation options to such destinations.
                    One option for Riders is to request a ride from rideshare drivers who are driving to or through
                    those destinations (“Drivers”). Drivers and Riders are collectively referred to herein as “Users,”
                    and the driving services provided by Drivers to Riders shall be referred to herein as “Rideshare
                    Services.” As a User, you authorize Lyft to match you with Drivers or Riders based on factors such
                    as your location, the requested pickup location, the estimated time to pickup, your destination,
                    User preferences, driver mode, and platform efficiency, and to cancel an existing match and/or
                    rematch you with a Driver or Rider based on the same considerations. Any decision by a User to offer
                    or accept Rideshare Services is a decision made in such User’s sole discretion. Each Rideshare
                    Service provided by a Driver to a Rider shall constitute a separate agreement between such persons.
                </p>
<p>
                    In certain markets, Riders may have the option to rent bikes or scooters through the Lyft Platform
                    to ride to their destination. In some markets these bikes and scooters are owned by Lyft. In other
                    markets Lyft operates a bike-share or scooter-share program on behalf of third parties. In either
                    case, your rental and use of bikes and scooters through the Lyft Platform is subject to additional
                    agreements between you and Lyft and third parties as applicable to the particular market
                    (“Supplemental Agreements”). Please review any applicable Supplemental Agreements carefully. IF YOU
                    DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT RENT
                    OR USE THE BIKES OR SCOOTERS IN SUCH MARKET. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and
                    the terms and conditions of any Supplemental Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.
                </p>

<section id="tos-modification-to-the-agreement">
<h2>Modification to the Agreement</h2>
<p>
                    Lyft reserves the right to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and such modifications
                    shall be binding on you only upon your acceptance of the modified Agreement. Lyft reserves the right
                    to modify any information on pages referenced in the hyperlinks from this Agreement from time to
                    time, and such modifications shall become effective upon posting. Continued use of the Lyft Platform
                    or Rideshare Services after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. Unless
                    material changes are made to the arbitration provisions herein, you agree that modification of this
                    Agreement does not create a renewed opportunity to opt out of arbitration (if applicable).
                </p>
</section>
<section id="tos-eligibility">
<h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p>
                    The Lyft Platform may only be used by individuals who have the right and authority to enter into
                    this Agreement and are fully able and competent to satisfy the terms, conditions, and obligations
                    herein. The Lyft Platform is not available to Users who have had their User account temporarily or
                    permanently deactivated. You may not allow other persons to use your User account, and you agree
                    that you are the sole authorized user of your account. To use the Lyft Platform, each User shall
                    create a User account. Each person may only create one User account, and Lyft reserves the right to
                    deactivate any additional or duplicate accounts. Your participation in certain Lyft programs and use
                    of certain Lyft products or services may be subject to additional eligibility requirements as
                    determined by Lyft.
                </p>
<p>
                    By becoming a User, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old. Notwithstanding
                    the foregoing, if you are the parent or legal guardian of a 16 or 17-year-old minor you may create a
                    Lyft account for such minor to use the Lyft Platform subject to the following requirements and
                    restrictions: (a) you ensure that the minor’s use of the Lyft Platform is limited solely to
                    accessing and using bike-share or scooter-share services where expressly permitted under the
                    Supplemental Agreement applicable to such services, (b) you determine that the bike-share and
                    scooter-share services are suitable for the minor, (c) you ensure that the minor’s use of the Lyft
                    Platform and applicable bike-share or scooter-share services is done in compliance and
                    acknowledgement of all applicable safety instructions and warnings in this Agreement, any applicable
                    Supplemental Agreements, and the Lyft App, (d) you ensure that the minor does not request or accept
                    any Rideshare Services unless accompanied by you or an authorized guardian, (e) you explain the
                    terms of this Agreement to the minor, and (f) you expressly guarantee the minor’s acceptance of the
                    terms of this Agreement.
                </p>
<p>
                    By creating a Lyft account for such minor, you hereby give permission and consent to
                    the Agreement on the minor’s behalf, and you shall assume any and all responsibility
                    and liability for the minor's use of the Lyft Platform as provided by the terms of this
                    Agreement and any applicable Supplemental Agreements. You will be responsible for any
                    breach of the above representations, warranties and/or this Agreement, and/or any
                    attempt of the minor to disaffirm this Agreement. Furthermore, you hereby represent
                    that you are fully authorized to execute this Agreement on behalf of yourself and
                    all other parents or legal guardians of the minor rider.

<h2>Charges</h2>
<p>
                    As a Rider, you understand that request or use of Rideshare Services may result in charges to you
                    (“Charges”). Charges related to bikes and scooters are addressed in the applicable Supplemental
                    Agreement. Charges for Rideshare Services include Fares and other applicable fees, tolls,
                    surcharges, and taxes as set forth on your market’s Lyft Cities page (<a href="https://www.lyft.com/cities">www.lyft.com/cities</a>), plus any
                    tips to the Driver that you elect to pay. Lyft has the authority and reserves the right to determine
                    and modify pricing by posting applicable pricing terms to your market’s Lyft Cities page or quoting
                    you a price for a specific ride at the time you make a request. Pricing may vary based on the type
                    of service you request (e.g., shared, economy, extra seats, luxury) as described on your market’s
                    Lyft Cities page. You are responsible for reviewing the applicable Lyft Cities page or price quote
                    within the Lyft App and shall be responsible for all Charges incurred under your User account
                    regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof.
                </p>
<p>
                    Fares. There are two types of Fares, variable and quoted.
                </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Variable Fares</strong>. Variable fares consist of a base charge and
                        incremental charges based on the duration and distance of your ride. For
                        particularly short rides, minimum fares may apply. Please note that we use GPS
                        data from your Driver’s phone to calculate the distance traveled on your ride.
                        We cannot guarantee the availability or accuracy of GPS data. If we lose signal
                        we will calculate time and distance using available data from your ride.
                    </li>
<li>
<strong>Quoted Fares</strong>. In some cases Lyft may quote you a Fare at the
                        time of your request. The quote is subject to change until the ride request is
                        confirmed. If during your ride you change your destination, make multiple
                        stops, or attempt to abuse the Lyft Platform, we may cancel the fare quote and
                        charge you a variable fare based on the time and distance of your ride. Lyft
                        does not guarantee that the quoted fare price will be equal to a variable fare
                        for the same ride. Quoted Fares may include the Fees and Other Charges below,
                        as applicable.
                    </li>
</ul>
<p>
                    Fees and Other Charges.
                </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Service Fee</strong>. You may be charged a “Service Fee” for each ride
                        as set forth on the applicable Lyft Cities page.
                    </li>
<li>
<strong>Prime Time</strong>. At certain times, including times of high demand for Rideshare
                        Services (“Prime Time”), you acknowledge that Charges may increase substantially. For all rides
                        with a variable fare, we will use reasonable efforts to inform you of any Prime Time increases
                        in effect at the time of your request. For Quoted Fares we may factor in the Prime Time
                        increases into the quoted price of the ride.

                    </li>
<li>
<strong>Cancellation Fee</strong>. After requesting a ride you may cancel it through the Lyft
                        App, but note that in certain cases a cancellation fee may apply. You may also be charged if you
                        fail to show up after requesting a ride. Please check out our Help Center to learn more about <a href="https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012922687-Cancellation-policy-for-passengers">Lyft’s
                            cancellation policy</a>, including applicable fees.
                    </li>
<li>
<strong>Damage Fee</strong>. If a Driver reports that you have materially
                        damaged the Driver's vehicle, you agree to pay a “Damage Fee” of up to $250
                        depending on the extent of the damage (as determined by Lyft in its sole
                        discretion), towards vehicle repair or cleaning. Lyft reserves the right (but
                        is not obligated) to verify or otherwise require documentation of damages prior
                        to processing the Damage Fee.
                    </li>
<li>
<strong>Tolls</strong>. In some instances tolls (or return tolls) may apply to
                        your ride. Please see our Help Center and your market’s Lyft Cities page for
                        more <a href="https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012927787-Toll-info-for-passengers">

                        <a href="https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012927227">tolls
                            and return charges</a>. We do not guarantee that the amount charged by Lyft
                        will match the toll charged to the Driver, if any.
                    </li>
<li>
<strong>Other Charges</strong>. Other fees and surcharges may apply to your ride, including:
                        actual or anticipated airport fees, state or local fees, or event fees as determined by Lyft or
                        its marketing partners. In addition, where required by law Lyft will collect applicable taxes.
                        See your market’s Lyft Cities page for details on other Charges that may apply to your ride.
                    </li>
<li>
<strong>Tips</strong>. Following a ride, you may elect to tip your Driver in cash or through the
                        Lyft Platform. You may also elect to set a default tip amount or percentage through the Lyft
                        App. Any tips will be provided entirely to the applicable Driver.
                    </li>
</ul>
<p>
                    General.
                </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Facilitation of Charges</strong>. All Charges are facilitated through a third-party
                        payment processor (e.g., First Data, Stripe, Inc., or Braintree, a division of PayPal, Inc.).
                        Lyft may replace its third-party payment processor without notice to you. Charges shall only be
                        made through the Lyft Platform. With the exception of tips, cash payments are strictly
                        prohibited. Your payment of Charges to Lyft satisfies your payment obligation for your use of
                        the Lyft Platform and Rideshare Services. Lyft may group multiple Charges into a single
                        aggregate transaction on your payment method based on the nature of the Charges and/or the
                        date(s) they were incurred. If you don't recognize a transaction, then check your ride receipts
                        and payment history.
                    </li>
<li>
<strong>No Refunds</strong>. All Charges are non-refundable. This no-refund
                        policy shall apply at all times regardless of your decision to terminate usage
                        of the Lyft Platform, any disruption to the Lyft Platform or Rideshare Services,
                        or any other reason whatsoever.
                    </li>
<li>
<strong>Coupons</strong>. You may receive coupons that you can apply toward payment of certain
                        Charges upon completion of a Ride. Coupons are only valid for use on the Lyft Platform, and are
                        not transferable or redeemable for cash except as required by law. Coupons cannot be combined
                        unless expressly provided otherwise, and if the cost of your ride exceeds the applicable credit
                        or discount value we will charge your payment method on file for the outstanding cost of the
                        Ride. For quoted or variable fares, Lyft may deduct the amount attributable to the Service Fee,
                        Tolls, or Other Charges before application of the coupon. Additional restrictions on coupons may
                        apply as communicated to you in a relevant promotion or by clicking on the relevant coupon
                        within the Promotions section of the Lyft App.
                    </li>
<li>
<strong>Credit Card Authorization</strong>. Upon addition of a new payment
                        method or each ride request, Lyft may seek authorization of your selected
                        payment method to verify the payment method, ensure the ride cost will be
                        covered, and protect against unauthorized behavior. The authorization is not a
                        charge, however, it may reduce your available credit by the authorization
                        amount until your bank’s next processing cycle. Should the amount of our
                        authorization exceed the total funds on deposit in your account, you may be
                        subject to overdraft of NSF charges by the bank issuing your debit or prepaid
                        card. We cannot be held responsible for these charges and are unable to assist
                        you in recovering them from your issuing bank. Check out our Help Center to

<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>
                        You possess a valid driver’s license and are authorized and medically fit to
                        operate a motor vehicle and have all appropriate licenses, approvals and

<li>
                        You own, or have the legal right to operate, the vehicle you use when providing
                        Rideshare Services; such vehicle is in good operating condition and meets the
                        industry safety standards and all applicable statutory and state department of
                        motor vehicle requirements for a vehicle of its kind; and any and all applicable
                        safety recalls have been remedied per manufacturer instructions.
                    </li>
<li>
                        You will not engage in reckless behavior while driving, drive unsafely, operate a vehicle that
                        is unsafe to drive, permit an unauthorized third party to accompany you in the vehicle while
                        providing Rideshare Services, provide Services as a Driver while under the influence of alcohol
                        or drugs, or take action that harms or threatens to harm the safety of the Lyft community or
                        third parties.
                    </li>
<li>
                        You will only provide Rideshare Services using the vehicle that has been reported to,
                        and approved by Lyft, and for which a photograph has been provided to Lyft, and you
                        will not transport more passengers than can securely be seated in such vehicle
                        (and no more than seven (7) passengers in any instance).
                    </li>
<li>
                        You will not, while providing the Rideshare Services, operate as a public or common
                        carrier or taxi service, accept street hails, charge for rides (except as
                        expressly provided in this Agreement), demand that a rider pay in cash, or use
                        a credit card reader, such as a Square Reader, to accept payment or engage in
                        any other activity in a manner that is inconsistent with your obligations under
                        this Agreement.
                    </li>
<li>
                        You will not attempt to defraud Lyft or Riders on the Lyft Platform or in
                        connection with your provision of Rideshare Services. If we suspect that you have
                        engaged in fraudulent activity we may withhold applicable Fares or other payments
                        for the ride(s) in question and take any other action against you available under
                        the law.

<li>

<li>
                        You agree that we may obtain information about you, including your criminal and

                        You have a valid policy of liability insurance (in coverage amounts consistent
                        with all applicable legal requirements) that names or schedules you for the
                        operation of the vehicle you use to provide Rideshare Services.

                    LYFT and other Lyft logos, designs, graphics, icons, scripts and service names are registered
                    trademarks, trademarks or trade dress of Lyft in the United States and/or other countries
                    (collectively, the “Lyft Marks”). If you provide Rideshare Services as a Driver, Lyft grants to you,
                    during the term of this Agreement, and subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of
                    this Agreement, a limited, revocable, non-exclusive license to display and use the Lyft Marks solely
                    on the Lyft stickers/decals, Lyft Amp, and any other Lyft-branded items provided by Lyft directly to
                    you in connection with providing the Rideshare Services (“License”). The License is non-transferable

                    sublicense with respect to any of the rights granted hereunder without Lyft’s prior written
                    permission, which it may withhold in its sole discretion. The Lyft logo (or any Lyft Marks) may not
                    be used in any manner that is likely to cause confusion, including but not limited to: use of a Lyft
                    Mark in a domain name or Lyft referral code, or use of a Lyft Mark as a social media handle or name,
                    avatar, profile photo, icon, favicon, or banner. You may identify yourself as a Driver on the Lyft
                    Platform, but may not misidentify yourself as Lyft, an employee of Lyft, or a representative of
                    Lyft.
                </p>
<p>
                    You acknowledge that Lyft is the owner and licensor of the Lyft Marks, including all goodwill
                    associated therewith, and that your use of the Lyft logo (or any Lyft Marks) will confer no interest
                    in or ownership of the Lyft Marks in you but rather inures to the benefit of Lyft. You agree to use
                    the Lyft logo strictly in accordance with Lyft’s Brand Guidelines, as may be provided to you and
                    revised from time to time, and to immediately cease any use that Lyft determines to nonconforming or
                    otherwise unacceptable.
                </p>
<p>
                    You agree that you will not: (1) create any materials that use the Lyft Marks or
                    any derivatives of the Lyft Marks as a trademark, service mark, trade name or trade
                    dress, other than as expressly approved by Lyft in writing; (2) use the Lyft Marks
                    in any way that tends to impair their validity as proprietary trademarks, service
                    marks, trade names or trade dress, or use the Lyft Marks other than in accordance
                    with the terms, conditions and restrictions herein; (3) take any other action that
                    would jeopardize or impair Lyft’s rights as owner of the Lyft Marks or the legality
                    and/or enforceability of the Lyft Marks, including, challenging or opposing Lyft’s
                    ownership in the Lyft Marks; (4) apply for trademark registration or renewal of
                    trademark registration of any of the Lyft Marks, any derivative of the Lyft Marks,
                    any combination of the Lyft Marks and any other name, or any trademark, service
                    mark, trade name, symbol or word which is similar to the Lyft Marks; (5) use the
                    Lyft Marks on or in connection with any product, service or activity that is in
                    violation of any law, statute, government regulation or standard.

                    You agree you will not rent, lease, lend, sell, or otherwise redistribute the

                    (including but not limited to signage, stickers, apparel, or decals) from any
                    source other than directly from Lyft.
                </p>
<p>
                    Violation of any provision of this License may result in immediate termination of
                    the License, in Lyft’s sole discretion, a takedown request sent to the appropriate
                    ISP, or social media platform, and/or a Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution
                    Policy Proceeding (or equivalent proceeding). If you create any materials
                    (physical or digital) bearing the Lyft Marks (in violation of this Agreement
                    or otherwise), you agree that upon their creation Lyft exclusively owns all right,
                    title and interest in and to such materials, including any modifications to the
                    Lyft Marks or derivative works based on the Lyft Marks or Lyft copyrights.
                    You further agree to assign any interest or right you may have in such materials
                    to Lyft, and to provide information and execute any documents as reasonably

<h2>Disclaimers</h2>
<p>
                    The following disclaimers are made on behalf of Lyft, our affiliates, subsidiaries,
                    parents, successors and assigns, and each of our respective officers, directors,
                    employees, agents, and shareholders.
                </p>
<p>
                    Lyft does not provide transportation services, and Lyft is not a transportation
                    carrier. Lyft is not a common carrier or public carrier. It is up to the Driver to
                    decide whether or not to offer a ride to a Rider contacted through the Lyft
                    Platform, and it is up to the Rider to decide whether or not to accept a ride from
                    any Driver contacted through the Lyft Platform. We cannot ensure that a Driver or
                    Rider will complete an arranged transportation service. We have no control over the
                    quality or safety of the transportation that occurs as a result of the Rideshare
                    Services.
                </p>
<p>
                    The Lyft Platform is provided on an “as is” basis and without any warranty or condition, express,
                    implied or statutory. We do not guarantee and do not promise any specific results from use of the
                    Lyft Platform and/or the Rideshare Services, including the ability to provide or receive Rideshare
                    Services at any given location or time. Lyft reserves the right, for example, to limit or eliminate
                    access to the Lyft Platform for Rideshare Services in specific geographic areas and/or at specific
                    times based on commercial viability, public health concerns, or changes in law. To the fullest
                    extent permitted by law, we specifically disclaim any implied warranties of title, merchantability,
                    fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Some states do not allow the disclaimer of
                    implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimer may not apply to you.
                </p>
<p>
                    We do not warrant that your use of the Lyft Platform or Rideshare Services will be accurate,
                    complete, reliable, current, secure, uninterrupted, always available, or error-free, or will meet
                    your requirements, that any defects in the Lyft Platform will be corrected, or that the Lyft
                    Platform is free of viruses or other harmful components. We disclaim liability for, and no warranty
                    is made with respect to, connectivity and availability of the Lyft Platform or Rideshare Services.
                </p>
<p>
                    We cannot guarantee that each Rider or Driver is who he or she claims to be. Please use common sense
                    when using the Lyft Platform and Rideshare Services, including looking at the photos of the Driver
                    or Rider you have matched with to make sure it is the same individual you see in person. Please note
                    that there are also risks of dealing with underage persons or people acting under false pretense,
                    and we do not accept responsibility or liability for any content, communication or other use or
                    access of the Lyft Platform by persons under the age of 18 in violation of this Agreement. We
                    encourage you to communicate directly with each potential Driver or Rider prior to engaging in an
                    arranged transportation service.

                    you post on the Lyft Platform or through the Rideshare Services or release to others.
                    We disclaim all liability, regardless of the form of action, for the acts or omissions
                    of other Users (including unauthorized users, or “hackers”).

                    its content providers, guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
                    reliability, or timeliness of location data tracked or displayed by the Lyft

                    Lyft advises you to use the Lyft Platform with a data plan with unlimited or very high data usage
                    limits, and Lyft shall not be responsible or liable for any fees, costs, or overage charges
                    associated with any data plan you use to access the Lyft Platform.

                This paragraph applies to any version of the Lyft Platform that you acquire from the Apple App Store.
                This Agreement is entered into between you and Lyft. Apple, Inc. (“Apple”) is not a party to this
                Agreement and shall have no obligations with respect to the Lyft Platform. Lyft, not Apple, is solely
                responsible for the Lyft Platform and the content thereof as set forth hereunder. However, Apple and
                Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement. Upon your acceptance of this
                Agreement, Apple shall have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this
                Agreement against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof. This Agreement incorporates by reference

                    As a Driver, you may be able to use "Lyft Nav built by Google" while providing Rideshare Services on
                    the Platform. Riders and Drivers may also use Google Maps while using the Lyft App. In either case,
                    you agree that Google may collect your location data when the Lyft App is running in order to
                    provide and improve Google's services, that such data may also be shared with Lyft in order to
                    improve its operations, and that Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/help/terms_maps/">terms</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en&amp;gl=gl">privacy policy</a> will apply to this

                    Lyft shall not be in breach of this Agreement nor liable for failure or delay in performing
                    obligations under this Agreement if such failure or delay results from events, circumstances or
                    causes beyond its reasonable control including (without limitation) natural disasters or acts of
                    God; acts of terrorism; labor disputes or stoppages; war; government action; epidemic or pandemic;
                    chemical or biological contamination; strikes, riots, or acts of domestic or international
                    terrorism; quarantines; national or regional emergencies; or any other cause, whether similar in
                    kind to the foregoing or otherwise, beyond the party’s reasonable control. All service dates under
                    this Agreement affected by force majeure shall be tolled for the duration of such force majeure. The
                    parties hereby agree, when feasible, not to cancel but reschedule the pertinent obligations as soon
                    as practicable after the force majeure condition ceases to exist.

<h5>
                    (a) Agreement to Binding Arbitration Between You and Lyft.
                </h5>
<p>
                    YOU AND LYFT MUTUALLY AGREE TO WAIVE OUR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES IN A COURT OF
                    LAW BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BY ARBITRATION, as set forth below. This
                    agreement to arbitrate (“Arbitration Agreement”) is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”);
                    but if the FAA is inapplicable for any reason, then this Arbitration Agreement is governed by the
                    laws of the State of Delaware, including Del. Code tit. 10, § 5701 et seq., without regard to choice
                    of law principles. This Arbitration Agreement survives after the Agreement terminates or your

                    BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. Except as expressly provided below,

                    directors, employees, agents, or shareholders. This Arbitration Agreement also applies to claims
                    between you and Lyft’s service providers, including but not limited to background check providers
                    and payment processors; and such service providers shall be considered intended third-party
                    beneficiaries of this Arbitration Agreement.
                </p>
<p>
                    Except as expressly provided below, ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US (EACH A “CLAIM” AND
                    COLLECTIVELY, “CLAIMS”) SHALL BE EXCLUSIVELY RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND
                    LYFT. These Claims include, but are not limited to, any dispute, claim or controversy, whether based
                    on past, present, or future events, arising out of or relating to: this Agreement and prior versions
                    thereof (including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof), the

                    of any express or implied contract or covenant, claims arising under federal or state consumer
                    protection laws; claims arising under antitrust laws, claims arising under the Telephone Consumer
                    Protection Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act; and claims arising under the Uniform Trade Secrets
                    Act, Civil Rights Act of 1964, Americans With Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination in Employment
                    Act, Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, Family Medical Leave Act, Fair Labor Standards Act,

                    matters, and all other federal and state statutory and common law claims. All disputes concerning
                    the arbitrability of a Claim (including disputes about the scope, applicability, enforceability,
                    revocability or validity of the Arbitration Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator, except as

                </p>
<p>
                    BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND LYFT ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT
                    OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL FOR ALL CLAIMS, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS ARBITRATION
                    AGREEMENT. This Arbitration Agreement is intended to require arbitration of every claim or dispute
                    that can lawfully be arbitrated, except for those claims and disputes which by the terms of this
                    Arbitration Agreement are expressly excluded from the requirement to arbitrate.
                </p>
<h5>
                    (b) Prohibition of Class Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.
                </h5>
<p class="uppercase">
                    You understand and agree that you and Lyft may each bring Claims in arbitration
                    against the other only in an individual capacity and not on a class, collective
                    action, or representative basis (“Class Action Waiver”). You understand and
                    agree that you and Lyft both are waiving the right to pursue or have a dispute
                    resolved as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective or
                    representative proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this subsection (b)
                    shall not apply to representative private attorneys general act claims brought
                    against Lyft, which are addressed separately in Section 17(c).
                </p>
<p>
                    The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue
                    any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. The arbitrator shall have
                    no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on a class,
                    collective, or representative basis. The arbitrator may award declaratory or
                    injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to
                    the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claims.
                </p>
<p>
                    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules,
                    disputes regarding the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of the Class Action Waiver
                    may be resolved only by a court and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which: (1) the dispute is
                    filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (2) there is a final judicial
                    determination that the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable with respect to any Claim or any
                    particular remedy for a Claim (such as a request for public injunctive relief), then that Claim or
                    particular remedy (and only that Claim or particular remedy) shall be severed from any remaining
                    claims and/or remedies and may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, but the Class Action
                    Waiver shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all other Claims or remedies to
                    the fullest extent possible.
                </p>
<h5>
                    (c) Representative PAGA Waiver.
                </h5>
<p>
                    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Arbitration
                    Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law: (1) you and Lyft agree not
                    to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the Private
                    Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”), California Labor Code § 2698 et seq.,
                    in any court or in arbitration, and (2) for any claim brought on a private
                    attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, both you and Lyft
                    agree that any such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual
                    basis only (i.e., to resolve whether you have personally been aggrieved or
                    subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to
                    resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective
                    proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or
                    subject to any violations of law) (collectively, “representative PAGA Waiver”).
                    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration
                    Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability,
                    enforceability, revocability or validity of this representative PAGA Waiver may
                    be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an
                    arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be
                    unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the unenforceable provision shall
                    be severed from this Agreement; (ii) severance of the unenforceable provision
                    shall have no impact whatsoever on the Arbitration Agreement or the requirement
                    that any remaining Claims be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the
                    Arbitration Agreement; and (iii) any such representative PAGA or other
                    representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a
                    civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent
                    that there are any Claims to be litigated in a civil court of competent
                    jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that
                    the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those Claims,
                    the Parties agree that litigation of those Claims shall be stayed pending the
                    outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration.
                </p>
<h5>
                    (d) Rules Governing the Arbitration.
                </h5>
<p>
                    Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement shall be administered by the
                    American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) pursuant to its <a href="https://www.adr.org/Rules">Consumer Arbitration Rules</a> that are in
                    effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, as modified by the terms set forth in this
                    Agreement. Copies of these rules can be obtained at the AAA’s website (www.adr.org) (the “AAA
                    Rules”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if requested by you and if proper based on the facts and
                    circumstances of the Claims presented, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select a
                    different set of AAA Rules, but in no event shall the arbitrator consolidate more than one person’s
                    Claims, or otherwise preside over any form of representative, collective, or class proceeding. The
                    parties may select a different arbitration administrator upon mutual written agreement.
                </p>
<p>
                    As part of the arbitration, both you and Lyft will have the opportunity for
                    reasonable discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the
                    Claim. The arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be
                    available in court. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief
                    only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
                    necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claims. The
                    arbitrator will provide a reasoned written statement of the arbitrator’s
                    decision which shall explain the award given and the findings and conclusions
                    on which the decision is based.
                </p>
<p>
                    The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with
                    applicable law, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The
                    arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving
                    different Riders or Drivers, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations
                    involving the same Rider or Driver to the extent required by applicable law.
                    The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award
                    rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
                    thereof, provided that any award may be challenged in a court of competent
                    jurisdiction.

<p>
                    The payment of filing and arbitration fees will be governed by the relevant AAA

                </p>
<ol>
<li>
                        If Lyft initiates arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, Lyft will
                        pay all AAA filing and arbitration fees.
                    </li>
<li>
                        With respect to any Claims brought by Lyft against a Driver, or for Claims brought by a Driver
                        against Lyft that: (A) are based on an alleged employment relationship between Lyft and a
                        Driver; (B) arise out of, or relate to, Lyft’s actual deactivation of a Driver’s User account or
                        a threat by Lyft to deactivate a Driver’s User account; (C) arise out of, or relate to, Lyft’s
                        actual termination of a Driver’s Agreement with Lyft under the termination provisions of this
                        Agreement, or a threat by Lyft to terminate a Driver’s Agreement; (D) arise out of, or relate
                        to, Fares (as defined in this Agreement, including Lyft’s commission or fees on the Fares),
                        tips, or average hourly guarantees owed by Lyft to Drivers for Rideshare Services, other than
                        disputes relating to referral bonuses, other Lyft promotions, or consumer-type disputes, or (E)

                        become a Driver (the subset of Claims in subsections (A)-(E) shall be collectively referred to
                        as “Driver Claims”), Lyft shall pay all costs unique to arbitration (as compared to the costs of
                        adjudicating the same claims before a court), including the regular and customary arbitration
                        fees and expenses (to the extent not paid by Lyft pursuant to the fee provisions above).
                        However, if you are the party initiating the Driver Claim, you shall be responsible for
                        contributing up to an amount equal to the filing fee that would be paid to initiate the claim in
                        the court of general jurisdiction in the state in which you provide Rideshare Services to
                        Riders, unless a lower fee amount would be owed by you pursuant to the AAA Rules, applicable
                        law, or subsection (e)(1) above. Any dispute as to whether a cost is unique to arbitration shall
                        be resolved by the arbitrator. For purposes of this Section 17(e)(2), the term “Driver” shall be
                        deemed to include both Drivers and Driver applicants who have not been approved to drive.

                        equivalents, each party shall pay its own attorneys’ fees and pay any costs
                        that are not unique to the arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would
                        incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a court such as costs to subpoena

<li>
                        At the end of any arbitration, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees and

                        fees and non-filing fee expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, Lyft
                        agrees that it will not seek such an award unless you are represented by an
                        attorney or the arbitrator has determined that the claim is frivolous or
                        brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards of Federal Rule

                        faith in the optional Negotiation process described in subsection (k)

                </h5>
<p>
                    Unless you and Lyft agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings between Lyft and
                    a Rider will take place in the county of your billing address, and any
                    arbitration hearings between Lyft and a Driver will take place in the county in
                    which the Driver provides Rideshare Services. If AAA arbitration is unavailable
                    in your county, the arbitration hearings will take place in the nearest available
                    location for a AAA arbitration. Your right to a hearing will be determined by the
                    AAA Rules.

<h5>
                    (g) Exceptions to Arbitration.
                </h5>
<p>
                    This Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following types of
                    claims: (1) small claims actions brought on an individual basis that are within the
                    scope of such small claims court’s jurisdiction; (2) a representative action
                    brought on behalf of others under PAGA or other private attorneys general acts, to
                    the extent the representative PAGA Waiver in Section 17(c) of such action is deemed
                    unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction under applicable law not
                    preempted by the FAA; (3) claims for workers’ compensation, state disability
                    insurance and unemployment insurance benefits; (4) claims that may not be
                    subject to arbitration as a matter of generally applicable law not preempted by the
                    FAA; and (5) individual claims of sexual assault or sexual harassment in connection
                    with the use of the Lyft Platform or Rideshare Services. Where these claims are
                    brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, Lyft will not require arbitration of
                    those claims. Lyft's agreement not to require arbitration of these claims does not
                    waive the enforceability of any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement
                    (including without limitation the waivers provided in Section 17(b)), or of the
                    enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement as to any other dispute, claim, or
                    controversy.

                    Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prevents you from making a report to or

                    Department of Labor, Securities Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board
                    (“NLRB”), or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, or similar local,
                    state or federal agency, and nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed
                    to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any
                    agency in order to fulfill the party's obligation to exhaust administrative
                    remedies before making a claim in arbitration However, should you bring an
                    administrative claim, you may only seek or recover money damages of any type
                    pursuant to this Arbitration Provision, and you knowingly and voluntarily waive the
                    right to seek or recover money damages of any type pursuant to any administrative
                    complaint, except for a complaint issued by the NLRB. Should you participate in an
                    NLRB proceeding, you may only recover money damages if such recovery does not arise
                    from or relate to a claim previously adjudicated under this Arbitration Provision
                    or settled by you. Similarly, you may not recover money damages under this
                    Arbitration Provision if you have already adjudicated such claim with the NLRB.
                    Nothing in this Agreement or Arbitration Agreement prevents your participation in
                    an investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise
                    covered by this Arbitration Provision.

                    event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable under
                    applicable law not preempted by the FAA, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the

                    filed with the court in that lawsuit prior to this Agreement’s effective date
                    (a “Pending Settlement Action”), then this Arbitration Agreement shall not
                    apply to your Driver Claims in that particular class action. Instead, your
                    Driver Claims in that Pending Settlement Action shall continue to be governed
                    by the arbitration provisions contained in the applicable Agreement that you

                    Settlement Action.
                </h5>
<p>
                    As a Driver or Driver applicant, you may opt out of the requirement to arbitrate Driver Claims
                    defined in Section 17(e)(2) (except as limited by Section 17(i) above) pursuant to the terms of this
                    subsection if you have not previously agreed to an arbitration provision in Lyft’s Terms of Service
                    where you had the opportunity to opt out of the requirement to arbitrate. If you have previously
                    agreed to such an arbitration provision, you may opt out of any revisions to your prior arbitration
                    agreement made by this provision in the manner specified below, but opting out of this arbitration
                    provision has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have
                    with Lyft. If you have not previously agreed to such an arbitration provision and do not wish to be
                    subject to this Arbitration Agreement with respect to Driver Claims, you may opt out of arbitration
                    with respect to such Driver Claims, other than those in a Pending Settlement Action, by notifying
                    Lyft in writing of your desire to opt out of arbitration for such Driver Claims, which writing must
                    be dated, signed and delivered by electronic mail to arbitrationoptout@lyft.com.
                </p>
<p>
                    In order to be effective, (A) the writing must clearly indicate your intent to
                    opt out of this Arbitration Agreement with respect to Driver Claims that are
                    not part of a Pending Settlement Action, (B) the writing must include the name,
                    phone number, and email address associated with your User Account, and (C) the
                    email containing the signed writing must be sent within 30 days of the date
                    this Agreement is executed by you. Should you not opt out within the 30-day
                    period, you and Lyft shall be bound by the terms of this Arbitration Agreement
                    in full (including with respect to Driver Claims that are not part of a Pending
                    Settlement Action). As provided in paragraph 17(i) above, any opt out that you
                    submit shall not apply to any Driver Claims that are part of a Pending
                    Settlement Action and your Driver Claims in any such Pending Settlement Action
                    shall continue to be governed by the arbitration provisions that are contained
                    in the applicable Lyft Terms of Use that you agreed to prior to the effective
                    date of this Agreement.
                </p>
<p>
                    Cases have been filed against Lyft and may be filed in the future involving Driver Claims. You
                    should assume that there are now, and may be in the future, lawsuits against Lyft alleging class,
                    collective, and/or representative Driver Claims in which the plaintiffs seek to act on your behalf,
                    and which, if successful, could result in some monetary recovery to you. But if you do agree to
                    arbitration of Driver Claims with Lyft under this Arbitration Agreement, you are agreeing in advance
                    that you will bring all such claims, and seek all monetary and other relief, against Lyft in an
                    individual arbitration, except for the Driver Claims that are part of a Pending Settlement Action.
                    You are also agreeing in advance that you will not participate in, or seek to recover monetary or
                    other relief, for such claims in any court action or class, collective, and/or representative
                    action. You have the right to consult with counsel of your choice concerning this Arbitration
                    Agreement and you will not be subject to retaliation if you exercise your right to assert claims or
                    opt-out of any Driver Claims under this Arbitration Agreement.

                    (k) Optional Pre-Arbitration Negotiation Process.
                </h5>
<p>
                    Before initiating any arbitration or proceeding, you and Lyft may agree to
                    first attempt to negotiate any dispute, claim or controversy between the
                    parties informally for 30 days, unless this time period is mutually extended by
                    you and Lyft. A party who intends to seek negotiation under this subsection
                    must first send to the other a written notice of the dispute (“Notice”). The
                    Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2)
                    set forth the specific relief sought. All offers, promises, conduct and
                    statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the negotiation by
                    any of the parties, their agents, employees, and attorneys are confidential,
                    privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including as evidence of liability
                    or for impeachment, in arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties,
                    provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not
                    be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the
                    negotiation.

<h2>Relationship with Lyft</h2>
<p>
                    As a Driver on the Lyft Platform, you acknowledge and agree that you and Lyft are in a direct
                    business relationship, and the relationship between the parties under this Agreement is solely that
                    of independent contracting parties. You and Lyft expressly agree that (1) this is not an employment
                    agreement and does not create an employment relationship between you and Lyft; and (2) no joint
                    venture, franchisor-franchisee, partnership, or agency relationship is intended or created by this
                    Agreement. You have no authority to bind Lyft, and you undertake not to hold yourself out as an
                    employee, agent or authorized representative of Lyft.
                </p>
<p>
                    Lyft does not, and shall not be deemed to, direct or control you generally or in your performance
                    under this Agreement specifically, including in connection with your provision of Rideshare
                    Services, your acts or omissions, or your operation and maintenance of your vehicle. You retain the
                    sole right to determine when, where, and for how long you will utilize the Lyft Platform. Lyft does
                    not, and shall not be deemed to, unilaterally prescribe specific dates, times of day, or any minimum
                    number of hours for you to utilize the Lyft Platform. You retain the option to accept or to decline
                    or ignore a Rider’s request for Rideshare Services via the Lyft Platform, or to cancel an accepted
                    request for Rideshare Services via the Lyft Platform, subject to Lyft’s then-current cancellation
                    policies. Lyft does not, and shall not be deemed to, require you to accept any specific request for
                    Rideshare Services as a condition of maintaining access to the platform. With the exception of any
                    signage required by law or permit/license rules or requirements, Lyft shall have no right to require
                    you to: (a) display Lyft’s names, logos or colors on your vehicle(s); or (b) wear a uniform or any
                    other clothing displaying Lyft’s names, logos or colors. You acknowledge and agree that you have
                    complete discretion to provide Rideshare Services or otherwise engage in any other business or
                    employment activities, including but not limited to providing services similar to the Rideshare
                    Services to other companies, and that Lyft does not, and shall not be deemed to, restrict you from
                    engaging in any such activity.

<h2>Other Services</h2>
<p>
                    In addition to connecting Riders with Drivers, the Lyft Platform may enable Users to provide or
                    receive services from other third parties. For example, Users may be able to use the Lyft Platform
                    to plan and reserve rides on public transportation, take a ride in an autonomous vehicle provided by
                    a third party, rent vehicles, or obtain financial services provided by third parties (collectively,
                    the “Other Services”). You understand that the Other Services are subject to the terms and pricing
                    of the third-party provider. If you choose to purchase Other Services through the Lyft Platform, you
                    authorize Lyft to charge your payment method on file according to the pricing terms set by the
                    third-party provider. You agree that Lyft is not responsible and may not be held liable for the
                    Other Services or the actions or omissions of the third-party provider. Such Other Services may not
                    be investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy, appropriateness, or completeness by us, and we
                    are not responsible for any Other Services accessed through the Lyft Platform. This Agreement
                    incorporates by reference <a href="https://www.adt.com/about-adt/legal/mobile-monitoring-terms-lyft">ADT Mobile Security
                        Monitoring Terms</a>. In the event of a conflict in the
                    terms of the ADT Mobile Security Monitoring Terms and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement
                    shall control with respect to Lyft and your agreements with Lyft herein, and the limitations of
                    liability set forth in Section 15 above shall also apply to ADT. The Dispute Resolution and
                    Arbitration Agreement provisions in Section 17 above shall apply instead of any terms in the ADT
                    Mobile Security Monitoring Terms for all purposes except with respect to claims that are solely
                    against ADT.

<h2>General</h2>
<p>
                    Except as provided in Section 17, this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of
                    the State of California without regard to choice of law principles. This choice of
                    law provision is only intended to specify the use of California law to interpret
                    this Agreement and is not intended to create any other substantive right to non-
                    Californians to assert claims under California law whether by statute, common law,
                    or otherwise. If any provision of this Agreement is or becomes invalid or non-
                    binding, the parties shall remain bound by all other provisions of this Agreement.
                    In that event, the parties shall replace the invalid or non-binding provision with
                    provisions that are valid and binding and that have, to the greatest extent
                    possible, a similar effect as the invalid or non-binding provision, given the
                    contents and purpose of this Agreement. You agree that this Agreement and all
                    incorporated agreements may be automatically assigned by Lyft, in our sole
                    discretion by providing notice to you. Except as explicitly stated otherwise, any
                    notices to Lyft shall be given by certified mail, postage prepaid and return
                    receipt requested to Lyft, Inc., 548 Market Street, #68514 San Francisco, CA
                    94104. Any notices to you shall be provided to you through the Lyft Platform or
                    given to you via the email address or physical you provide to Lyft during the
                    registration process. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way

                    to subsequent or similar breaches. This Agreement sets forth the entire
                    understanding and agreement between you and Lyft with respect to the subject matter

                    information about your device. We also collect information about you from other sources like
                    third-party services, and optional programs in which you participate, which we may combine with
                    other information we have about you. Here are the types of information we collect about you:
                </p>

<h3>A. Information You Provide to Us</h3>

                        such as your name, email address, phone number, birth date, and payment information. You may
                        choose to share additional
                        info with us for your Rider profile, like your photo or saved addresses (e.g., home or work),
                        and set up other
                        preferences (such as your preferred pronouns).
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Driver Information.</strong> If you apply to be a Driver, we will collect the
                        information you provide in your
                        application, including your name, email address, phone number, birth date, profile photo,

                        information, and car

                        routing numbers, and tax information. Depending on where you want to drive, we may also ask for
                        additional business license or permit information or other information to manage driving and
                        programs relevant to that location. We may need additional information from you at some point
                        after you become a Driver, including information to confirm your identity (like a photo).
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Ratings and Feedback.</strong> When you rate and provide feedback about Riders or
                        Drivers, we collect all of the

<h3>B. Information We Collect When You Use the Lyft Platform</h3>
<p>
<strong>Location Information.</strong> Great rides start with an easy and accurate pickup. The
                        Lyft Platform collects
                        location information (including GPS and WiFi data) differently depending on your Lyft app
                        settings and device
                        permissions as well as whether you are using the platform as a Rider or Driver:
                    </p>
<ul>
<li>
                            Riders: We collect your device’s precise location when you open and use the Lyft app,
                            including while the app is running
                            in the background from the time you request a ride until it ends. Lyft also tracks the
                            precise location of scooters and
                            e-bikes at all times.
                        </li>
<li>
                            Drivers: We collect your device’s precise location when you open and use the app, including
                            while the app is running in
                            the background when it is in driver mode. We also collect precise location for a limited
                            time after you exit driver mode
                            in order to detect ride incidents, and continue collecting it until a reported or detected
                            incident is no longer active.
                        </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Usage Information.</strong> We collect information about your use of the Lyft Platform,
                        including ride
                        information like the date, time, destination, distance, route, payment, and whether you used a
                        promotional or referral
                        code. We also collect information about your interactions with the Lyft Platform like our apps
                        and websites, including
                        the pages and content you view and the dates and times of your use.
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Device Information.</strong> We collect information about the devices you use to access
                        the Lyft Platform,
                        including device model, IP address, type of browser, version of operating system, identity of
                        carrier and manufacturer,
                        radio type (such as 4G), preferences and settings (such as preferred language), application
                        installations, device
                        identifiers, advertising identifiers, and push notification tokens. If you are a Driver, we also
                        collect mobile sensor
                        data from your device (such as speed, direction, height, acceleration, deceleration, and other
                        technical data).
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Communications Between Riders and Drivers.</strong> We work with a third party to
                        facilitate phone calls and
                        text messages between Riders and Drivers without sharing either party’s actual phone number with
                        the other. But while we
                        use a third party to provide the communication service, we collect information about these
                        communications, including the
                        participants’ phone numbers, the date and time, and the contents of SMS messages. For security
                        purposes, we may also
                        monitor or record the contents of phone calls made through the Lyft Platform, but we will always
                        let you know we are
                        about to do so before the call begins.
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Address Book Contacts.</strong> You may set your device permissions to grant Lyft access
                        to your contact lists
                        and direct Lyft to access your contact list, for example to help you refer friends to Lyft. If
                        you do this, we will
                        access and store the names and contact information of the people in your address book.
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies, Analytics, and Third-Party Technologies.</strong> We collect information
                        through the use of “cookies”,
                        tracking pixels, data analytics tools like <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">Google
                            Analytics</a>, SDKs, and other third-party technologies to understand how you navigate
                        through the Lyft Platform and
                        interact with Lyft advertisements, to make your Lyft experience safer, to learn what content is
                        popular, to improve your
                        site experience, to serve you better ads on other sites, and to save your preferences. Cookies
                        are small text files that
                        web servers place on your device; they are designed to store basic information and to help
                        websites and apps recognize
                        your browser. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie
                        disappears after you close your

                        you use the Lyft
                        Platform. You should consult your web browser(s) to modify your cookie settings. Please note
                        that if you delete or

<strong>Enterprise Programs.</strong> If you use Lyft through your employer or other
                        organization that participates in
                        one of our Lyft Business enterprise programs, we will collect information about you from those

<strong>Concierge Service.</strong> Sometimes another business or entity may order you a Lyft
                        ride. If an organization
                        has ordered a ride for you using our Concierge service, they will provide us your contact
                        information and the pickup and
                        drop-off location of your ride.

<strong>Referral Programs.</strong> Friends help friends use the Lyft Platform. If someone

                        collect information about you from that referral including your name and contact information.

<h2>How We Share Your Information</h2>
<p>
                    We do not sell your personal information. To make the Lyft Platform work, we may need to share your
                    personal information
                    with other users, third parties, and service providers. This section explains when and why we share
                    your information.
                </p>
<section id="privacy-sharing-between-users">
<h3>A. Sharing Between Lyft Users</h3>
<p><strong>Riders and Drivers.</strong></p>
<p>
<em>Rider information shared with Driver:</em> Upon receiving a ride request, we share with the
                        Driver the Rider’s
                        pickup location, name, profile photo, rating, Rider statistics (like approximate number of rides
                        and years as a Rider),
                        and information the Rider includes in their Rider profile (like preferred pronouns). Upon pickup
                        and during the ride, we
                        share with the Driver the Rider’s destination and any additional stops the Rider inputs into the
                        Lyft app. Once the ride
                        is finished, we also eventually share the Rider’s rating and feedback with the Driver. (We
                        remove the Rider’s identity
                        associated with ratings and feedback when we share it with Drivers, but a Driver may be able to
                        identify the Rider that
                        provided the rating or feedback.)
                    </p>
<p>
<em>Driver information shared with Rider:</em> Upon a Driver accepting a requested ride, we will
                        share with the Rider
                        the Driver’s name, profile photo, preferred pronouns, rating, real-time location, and the
                        vehicle make, model, color,
                        and license plate, as well as other information in the Driver’s Lyft profile, such as
                        information Drivers choose to add
                        (like country flag and why you drive) and Driver statistics (like approximate number of rides
                        and years as a Driver).
                    </p>
<p>
                        Although we help Riders and Drivers communicate with one another to arrange a pickup, we do not
                        share your actual phone
                        number or other contact information with other users. If you report a lost or found item to us,
                        we will seek to connect
                        you with the relevant Rider or Driver, including sharing actual contact information with your
                        consent.
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Shared Ride Riders.</strong> When Riders use a Lyft Shared ride, we share each Rider’s
                        name and profile picture
                        to ensure safety. Riders may also see each other’s pickup and drop-off locations as part of
                        knowing the route while
                        sharing the ride.
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Rides Requested or Paid For by Others.</strong> Some rides you take may be requested or
                        paid for by others. If you take one of those rides using your Lyft Business Profile account, a
                        code or coupon, a subsidized program (e.g., transit or government), or a corporate credit card
                        linked to another account, or another user otherwise requests or pays for a ride for you, we may
                        share some or all of your ride details with that other party, including the date, time, charge,
                        rating given, region of trip, and pick up and drop off location of your ride.

                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Referral Programs.</strong> If you refer someone to the Lyft Platform, we will let them
                        know that you generated
                        the referral. If another user referred you, we may share information about your use of the Lyft
                        Platform with that user.
                        For example, a referral source may receive a bonus when you join the Lyft Platform or complete a
                        certain number of rides
                        and would receive such information.

<h2>How We Store and Protect Your Information</h2>
<p>
                    We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide you and our other users the Lyft
                    Platform. This means we
                    keep your profile information for as long as you maintain an account. We retain transactional
                    information such as rides
                    and payments for at least seven years to ensure we can perform legitimate business functions, such
                    as accounting for tax
                    obligations. If you request account deletion, we will delete your information as set forth in the
                    “Deleting Your
                    Account” section below.
                </p>
<p>
                    We take reasonable and appropriate measures designed to protect your personal information. But no
                    security measures can
                    be 100% effective, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information, including against
                    unauthorized intrusions
                    or acts by third parties.

<h2>Your Rights And Choices Regarding Your Data</h2>
<p>
                    As explained more below and on our <a href="https://www.lyft.com/privacy/home">privacy homepage</a>,
                    Lyft provides ways
                    for you to access and delete your personal information as well as exercise other data rights that
                    give you certain
                    control over your personal information.
                </p>

<h3>A. All Users</h3>
<p>
<strong>Email Subscriptions.</strong> You can always unsubscribe from our commercial or
                        promotional emails by clicking
                        unsubscribe in those messages. We will still send you transactional and relational emails about
                        your use of the Lyft
                        Platform.
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Text Messages.</strong> You can opt out of receiving commercial or promotional text
                        messages by texting the word
                        END to 46080 from the mobile device receiving the messages. You may also opt out of receiving
                        all texts from Lyft
                        (including transactional or relational messages) by texting the word STOPALL to 46080 from the
                        mobile device receiving
                        the messages. Note that opting out of receiving all texts may impact your use of the Lyft
                        Platform. Drivers can also opt
                        out of driver-specific messages by texting STOP in response to a driver SMS. To re-enable texts
                        you can text START in
                        response to an unsubscribe confirmation SMS.
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Push Notifications.</strong> You can opt out of receiving push notifications through
                        your device settings.
                        Please note that opting out of receiving push notifications may impact your use of the Lyft
                        Platform (such as receiving
                        a notification that your ride has arrived).
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Profile Information.</strong> You can review and edit certain account information you
                        have chosen to add to your
                        profile by logging in to your account settings and profile.
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Location Information.</strong> You can prevent your device from sharing location
                        information through your
                        device’s system settings. But if you do, this may impact Lyft’s ability to provide you our full
                        range of features and
                        services.
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Cookie Tracking.</strong> You can modify your cookie settings on your browser, but if
                        you delete or choose not
                        to accept our cookies, you may be missing out on certain features of the Lyft Platform.
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Do Not Track.</strong> Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows
                        you to signal to
                        operators of websites and web applications and services that you do not want them to track your
                        online activities. The
                        Lyft Platform does not currently support Do Not Track requests at this time.
                    </p>
<p>
<strong>Deleting Your Account.</strong> If you would like to delete your Lyft account, please
                        visit our
                        <a href="https://www.lyft.com/privacy/home">privacy homepage</a>. In some cases, we will be
                        unable to delete your account, such as
                        if there is an issue with your account related to trust, safety, or fraud. When we delete your
                        account, we may retain
                        certain information for legitimate business purposes or to comply with legal or regulatory
                        obligations. For example, we
                        may retain your information to resolve open insurance claims, or we may be obligated to retain
                        your information as part
                        of an open legal claim. When we retain such data, we do so in ways designed to prevent its use
                        for other purposes.

For\n                        particularly short rides, minimum fares may apply.

If during your ride you change your destination, make multiple\n                        stops, or attempt to abuse the Lyft Platform, we may cancel the fare quote and\n                        charge you a variable fare based on the time and distance of your ride.
