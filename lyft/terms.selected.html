           Lyft Terms of Service
          </h1>
          <p>
           Last Updated: November 27, 2019
          </p>
          <p>
           These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement (the “Agreement”)
                    between you and Lyft, Inc., its parents, subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates,
                    officers and directors (collectively, “Lyft,” “we,” “us” or “our”) governing your use
                    of the Lyft application, website, and technology platform (collectively, the “Lyft
                    Platform”).
          </p>
          <p class="uppercase">
           Please be advised: This Agreement contains provisions that govern how claims between
                    you and Lyft can be brought
                    (
           <a href="#tos-dispute-resolution-and-arbitration-agreement">
            see Section 17 below
           </a>
           ).
                    These provisions will, with limited exception, require you to submit claims you
                    have against Lyft to binding and final arbitration on an individual basis, not as a
                    plaintiff or class member in any class, group or representative action or
                    proceeding. As a Driver or Driver applicant, you have an opportunity to opt out of
                    arbitration with respect to certain claims as provided in Section 17.
          </p>
          <p>
           By entering into this Agreement, and/or by using or accessing the Lyft Platform
                    you expressly acknowledge that you understand this Agreement (including the dispute
                    resolution and arbitration provisions in Section 17) and accept all of its terms.
           <span class="uppercase">
            If you do not agree to be bound by the terms and
                    conditions of this Agreement, you may not use or access the Lyft Platform or any of
                    the services provided through the Lyft Platform.
           </span>
           If you use the Lyft Platform
                    in another country, you agree to be subject to Lyft's terms of service for that country.

           The Lyft Platform
          </h2>
          <p>
           The Lyft Platform provides a marketplace where persons who seek transportation to
                    certain destinations (“Riders”) can be matched with transportation options to such
                    destinations. One option for Riders is to request a ride from rideshare drivers who
                    are driving to or through those destinations (“Drivers”). Drivers and Riders are
                    collectively referred to herein as “Users,” and the driving services provided by
                    Drivers to Riders shall be referred to herein as "Rideshare Services." As a User,
                    you authorize Lyft to match you with a Driver or Rider based on factors such as
                    your location, the estimated time to pickup, your destination, user preferences, and
                    platform efficiency, and to cancel an existing match and rematch based on the same
                    considerations. Any decision by a User to offer or accept Rideshare Services is a
                    decision made in such User’s sole discretion. Each Rideshare Service provided by a
                    Driver to a Rider shall constitute a separate agreement between such persons.
          </p>
          <p>
           In certain markets, Riders may have the option to rent bikes or scooters through the
                    Lyft Platform to ride to their destination. In some markets these bikes and scooters
                    are owned by Lyft. In other markets Lyft operates a bike-share or scooter-share
                    program on behalf of third parties. In either case, your rental and use of bikes and
                    scooters through the Lyft Platform is subject to additional agreements between you and
                    Lyft and third parties as applicable to the particular market ("Supplemental Agreements").
                    Please review any applicable Supplemental Agreements carefully.
           <span class="uppercase">
            If
                    you do not agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of a supplemental agreement,
                    you may not rent or use the bikes or scooters in such market.
           </span>
           In the event of
                    any conflict between this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any Supplemental
                    Agreement, the terms of this agreement shall control.

           Modification to the Agreement
          </h2>
          <p>
           Lyft reserves the right to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such
                    modifications shall be binding on you only upon your acceptance of the modified
                    Agreement. Lyft reserves the right to modify any information on pages referenced in
                    the hyperlinks from this Agreement from time to time, and such modifications shall
                    become effective upon posting. Continued use of the Lyft Platform or Rideshare Services
                    after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. Unless material
                    changes are made to the arbitration provisions herein, you agree that modification
                    of this Agreement does not create a renewed opportunity to opt out of arbitration

           Eligibility

          <p>
           The Lyft Platform may only be used by individuals who have the right and
                    authority to enter into this Agreement, are fully able and competent to satisfy
                    the terms, conditions, and obligations herein. The Lyft Platform is not
                    available to Users who have had their User account temporarily or permanently
                    deactivated. You may not allow other persons to use your User account, and you
                    agree that you are the sole authorized user of your account. To use the Lyft
                    Platform, each User shall create a User account. Each person may only create
                    one User account, and Lyft reserves the right to deactivate any additional or
                    duplicate accounts.
          </p>
          <p>
           By becoming a User, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years
                    old.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are the parent or legal guardian of
                    a 16 or 17-year old minor you may create a Lyft account for such minor to use
                    the Lyft Platform subject to the following requirements and restrictions: (a)
                    you ensure that the minor’s use of the Lyft Platform is limited solely to
                    accessing and using bike-share or scooter-share services where expressly
                    permitted under the Supplemental Agreement applicable to such services, (b) you
                    ensure that the minor’s use of the Lyft Platform and applicable bike-share or
                    scooter-share services is done in compliance and acknowledgement of all
                    applicable safety instructions and warnings in this Agreement, any applicable
                    Supplemental Agreements, and the Lyft App, (c) you ensure that the minor does
                    not request or accept any Rideshare Services unless accompanied by you or an
                    authorized guardian, and (d) you expressly guarantee the minor’s acceptance of
                    the terms of this Agreement. You will be responsible for any breach of the above
                    representations, warranties and/or this Agreement, and/or any attempt of the
                    minor to disaffirm this Agreement. Furthermore, you hereby represent that you
                    are fully authorized to execute this Agreement on behalf of yourself and all
                    other parents or legal guardians of the minor rider.
          </p>
          <p>
           By creating a Lyft account for such minor, you hereby give permission and consent to
                    the Agreement on the minor’s behalf, and you shall assume any and all responsibility
                    and liability for the minor's use of the Lyft Platform as provided by the terms of this
                    Agreement and any applicable Supplemental Agreements. You will be responsible for any
                    breach of the above representations, warranties and/or this Agreement, and/or any
                    attempt of the minor to disaffirm this Agreement. Furthermore, you hereby represent

           Charges
          </h2>
          <p>
           As a rider, you understand that request or use of Rideshare Services may result
                    in  charges to you (“Charges”). Charges related to bikes and scooters are
                    addressed in  the applicable Supplemental Agreement. Charges for Rideshare
                    Services include Fares  and other applicable fees, tolls, surcharges, and taxes
                    as set forth on your market’s Lyft Cities page (
           <a href="https://www.lyft.com/cities">
            www.lyft.com/cities
           </a>
           ), plus any tips to
                    the  Driver that you elect to pay. Lyft has the authority and reserves the right
                    to  determine and modify pricing by posting applicable pricing terms to your
                    market’s  Lyft Cities page or quoting you a price for a specific ride at the
                    time you make a  request. Pricing may vary based on the type of service you
                    request (e.g., shared,  economy, extra seats, luxury) as described on your
                    market’s Lyft Cities page. You are  responsible for reviewing the applicable
                    Lyft Cities page or price quote within the  Lyft app and shall be responsible
                    for all Charges incurred under your User account  regardless of your awareness
                    of such Charges or the amounts thereof.
          </p>
          <p>
           Fares. There are two types of fares, variable and quoted.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Variable Fares
            </strong>
            . Variable fares consist of a base charge and
                        incremental charges based on the duration and distance of your ride. For
                        particularly short rides, minimum fares may apply. Please note that we use GPS
                        data from your Driver’s phone to calculate the distance traveled on your ride.
                        We cannot guarantee the availability or accuracy of GPS data. If we lose signal
                        we will calculate time and distance using available data from your ride.
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Quoted Fares
            </strong>
            . In some cases Lyft may quote you a Fare at the
                        time of your request. The quote is subject to change until the ride request is
                        confirmed. If during your ride you change your destination, make multiple
                        stops, or attempt to abuse the Lyft Platform, we may cancel the fare quote and
                        charge you a variable fare based on the time and distance of your ride. Lyft
                        does not guarantee that the quoted fare price will be equal to a variable fare
                        for the same ride. Quoted Fares may include the Fees and Other Charges below,
                        as applicable.

                        third-party payment processor (e.g., First Data, Stripe, Inc., or Braintree, a
                        division of PayPal, Inc.). Lyft may replace its third-party payment processor
                        without notice to you. Charges shall only be made through the Lyft
                        Platform. With the exception of tips, cash payments are strictly prohibited.
                        Your payment of Charges to Lyft satisfies your payment obligation for your use
                        of the Lyft Platform and Rideshare Services. Lyft may group multiple charges
                        into a single aggregate transaction on your payment method based on the date(s)
                        they were incurred. If you don't recognize a transaction, then check your ride

                        payment of certain Charges upon completion of a Ride. Coupons are only valid

                        except as required by law.  Coupons cannot be combined, and if the cost of your
                        ride exceeds the applicable credit or discount value we will charge your
                        payment method on file for the outstanding cost of the Ride. For quoted or
                        variable fares, Lyft may deduct the amount attributable to the Service Fee,
                        Tolls, or Other Charges before application of the coupon. Additional
                        restrictions on coupons may apply as communicated to you in a relevant
                        promotion or by clicking on the relevant coupon within the Promotions

            . Upon addition of a new payment
                        method or each ride request, Lyft may seek authorization of your selected
                        payment method to verify the payment method, ensure the ride cost will be
                        covered, and protect against unauthorized behavior. The authorization is not a
                        charge, however, it may reduce your available credit by the authorization
                        amount until your bank’s next processing cycle. Should the amount of our
                        authorization exceed the total funds on deposit in your account, you may be
                        subject to overdraft of NSF charges by the bank issuing your debit or prepaid

           LYFT and other Lyft logos, designs, graphics, icons, scripts and service names are
                    registered trademarks, trademarks or trade dress of Lyft in the United States
                    and/or other countries (collectively, the “Lyft Marks”). If you provide Rideshare
                    Services as a Driver, Lyft grants to you, during the term of this Agreement, and
                    subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, a limited,
                    revocable, non-exclusive license to display and use the Lyft Marks solely on the

                    directly to you in connection with providing the Rideshare Services ("License").
                    The License is non-transferable and non-assignable, and you shall not grant to any

                    used in any manner that is likely to cause confusion, including but not limited
                    to: use of a Lyft Mark in a domain name or Lyft referral code, or use of a Lyft

                    not misidentify yourself as Lyft, an employee of Lyft, or a representative of Lyft.

           You acknowledge that Lyft is the owner and licensor of the Lyft Marks, including
                    all goodwill associated therewith, and that your use of the Lyft logo
                    (or any Lyft Marks) will confer no interest in or ownership of the Lyft Marks in you
                    but rather inures to the benefit of Lyft. You agree to use the Lyft logo strictly in
                    accordance with Lyft’s Trademark Usage Guidelines, as may be provided to you and revised
                    from time to time, and to immediately cease any use that Lyft determines to nonconforming

                    and/or enforceability of the Lyft Marks, including, challenging or opposing Lyft’s
                    ownership in the Lyft Marks; (4) apply for trademark registration or renewal of
                    trademark registration of any of the Lyft Marks, any derivative of the Lyft Marks,
                    any combination of the Lyft Marks and any other name, or any trademark, service
                    mark, trade name, symbol or word which is similar to the Lyft Marks; (5) use the

                    Platform, and it is up to the Rider to decide whether or not to accept a ride from
                    any Driver contacted through the Lyft Platform. We cannot ensure that a Driver or
                    Rider will complete an arranged transportation service. We have no control over the
                    quality or safety of the transportation that occurs as a result of the Rideshare

                    any specific results from use of the Lyft Platform and/or the Rideshare Services,

           This Arbitration Agreement is intended to require arbitration of every claim or

                    action, or representative basis (“Class Action Waiver”).  You understand and
                    agree that you and Lyft both are waiving the right to pursue or have a dispute
                    resolved as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective or
                    representative proceeding.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this subsection (b)
                    shall not apply to representative private attorneys general act claims brought

           The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue
                    any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. The arbitrator shall have
                    no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on a class,
                    collective, or representative basis. The arbitrator may award declaratory or
                    injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to
                    the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claims.

                    civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in
                    which: (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action
                    and (2) there is a final judicial determination that the Class Action Waiver is
                    unenforceable with respect to any Claim or any particular remedy for a Claim
                    (such as a request for public injunctive relief), then that Claim or particular
                    remedy (and only that Claim or particular remedy) shall be severed from any
                    remaining claims and/or remedies and may be brought in a civil court of
                    competent jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver shall be enforced in
                    arbitration on an individual basis as to all other Claims or remedies to the
                    fullest extent possible.

           Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Arbitration
                    Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law: (1) you and Lyft agree not
                    to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the Private
                    Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”), California Labor Code § 2698 et seq.,
                    in any court or in arbitration, and (2) for any claim brought on a private
                    attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, both you and Lyft
                    agree that any such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual
                    basis only (i.e., to resolve whether you have personally been aggrieved or
                    subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to
                    resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective
                    proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or
                    subject to any violations of law) (collectively, “representative PAGA Waiver”).
                    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration
                    Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability,
                    enforceability, revocability or validity of this representative PAGA Waiver may
                    be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an
                    arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be
                    unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the unenforceable provision shall
                    be severed from this Agreement; (ii) severance of the unenforceable provision
                    shall have no impact whatsoever on the Arbitration Agreement or the requirement
                    that any remaining Claims be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the
                    Arbitration Agreement; and (iii) any such representative PAGA or other
                    representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a

                    that there are any Claims to be litigated in a civil court of competent
                    jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that
                    the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those Claims,
                    the Parties agree that litigation of those Claims shall be stayed pending the
                    outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration.

           (d) Rules Governing the Arbitration.
          </h5>
          <p>
           Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement shall be
                    administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) pursuant to its
           <a href="https://www.adr.org/aaa/faces/rules/searchrules/rulesdetail?_afrWindowId=57rsw71ei_1&amp;_afrLoop=1335893675945842&amp;doc=ADRSTAGE2021424&amp;_afrWindowMode=0&amp;_adf.ctrl-state=hf27f5iaa_4#%40%3F_afrWindowId%3D57rsw71ei_1%26_afrLoop%3D1335893675945842%26doc%3DADRSTAGE2021424%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3D57rsw71ei_79">
            Consumer Arbitration Rules
           </a>
           that are in effect at the time the arbitration
                    is initiated, as modified by the terms set forth in this Agreement. Copies of
                    these rules can be obtained at the AAA’s website (www.adr.org) (the “AAA
                    Rules”) or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
                    if requested by you and if proper based on the facts and circumstances of the
                    Claims presented, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select a
                    different set of AAA Rules, but in no event shall the arbitrator consolidate
                    more than one person’s Claims, or otherwise preside over any form of
                    representative, collective, or class proceeding. The parties may select a
                    different arbitration administrator upon mutual written agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
           As part of the arbitration, both you and Lyft will have the opportunity for
                    reasonable discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the
                    Claim. The arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be
                    available in court. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief
                    only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
                    necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claims. The
                    arbitrator will provide a reasoned written statement of the arbitrator’s
                    decision which shall explain the award given and the findings and conclusions
                    on which the decision is based.
          </p>
          <p>
           The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with
                    applicable law, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The
                    arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving
                    different Riders or Drivers, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations
                    involving the same Rider or Driver to the extent required by applicable law.
                    The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award
                    rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
                    thereof, provided that any award may be challenged in a court of competent
                    jurisdiction.

           (e) Arbitration Fees and Awards.
          </h5>
          <p>
           The payment of filing and arbitration fees will be governed by the relevant AAA
                    Rules subject to the following modifications:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            If Lyft initiates arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, Lyft will
                        pay all AAA filing and arbitration fees.
           </li>
           <li>
            With respect to any Claims brought by Lyft against a Driver, or for Claims
                        brought by a Driver against Lyft that: (A) are based on an alleged employment
                        relationship between Lyft and a Driver; (B) arise out of, or relate to, Lyft’s
                        actual deactivation of a Driver’s User account or a threat by Lyft to
                        deactivate a Driver’s User account; (C) arise out of, or relate to, Lyft’s
                        actual termination of a Driver’s Agreement with Lyft under the termination
                        provisions of this Agreement, or a threat by Lyft to terminate a Driver’s
                        Agreement; (D) arise out of, or relate to, Fares (as defined in this Agreement,
                        including Lyft’s commission or fees on the Fares), tips, or average hourly
                        guarantees owed by Lyft to Drivers for Rideshare Services, other than disputes
                        relating to referral bonuses, other Lyft promotions, or consumer-type disputes,
                        or (E) arise out of or relate to background checks performed in connection with
                        a user seeking to become a Driver (the subset of Claims in subsections (A)-(E)
                        shall be collectively referred to as “Driver Claims”), Lyft shall pay all costs
                        unique to arbitration (as compared to the costs of adjudicating the same claims
                        before a court), including the regular and customary arbitration fees and
                        expenses (to the extent not paid by Lyft pursuant to the fee provisions above).
                        However, if you are the party initiating the Driver Claim, you shall be
                        responsible for contributing up to an amount equal to the filing fee that would
                        be paid to initiate the claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state
                        in which you provide Rideshare Services to Riders, unless a lower fee amount would
                        be owed by you pursuant to the AAA Rules, applicable law, or subsection (e)(1)
                        above.  Any dispute as to whether a cost is unique to arbitration shall be
                        resolved by the arbitrator. For purposes of this Section 17(e)(3), the term
                        “Driver” shall be deemed to include both Drivers and Driver applicants who have
                        not been approved to drive.
           </li>
           <li>
            Except as provided in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 or any state
                        equivalents, each party shall pay its own attorneys’ fees and pay any costs
                        that are not unique to the arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would
                        incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a court such as costs to subpoena
                        witnesses and/or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition
                        transcripts, copy documents, etc.).
           </li>
           <li>
            At the end of any arbitration, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees and
                        costs or any portion thereof to you if you prevail, to the extent
                        authorized by applicable law.
           </li>
           <li>
            Although under some laws Lyft may have a right to an award of attorneys'
                        fees and non-filing fee expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, Lyft
                        agrees that it will not seek such an award unless you are represented by an
                        attorney or the arbitrator has determined that the claim is frivolous or
                        brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards of Federal Rule
                        of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
           </li>
           <li>
            If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of
                        Lyft’s last written settlement offer made after you participated in good
                        faith in the optional Negotiation process described in subsection (k)
                        below, then Lyft will pay you the amount of the award or U.S. $1,000,
                        whichever is greater.

           (f) Location and Manner of Arbitration.
          </h5>
          <p>
           Unless you and Lyft agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings between Lyft and
                    a Rider will take place in the county of your billing address, and any
                    arbitration hearings between Lyft and a Driver will take place in the county in
                    which the Driver provides Rideshare Services. If AAA arbitration is unavailable
                    in your county, the arbitration hearings will take place in the nearest available
                    location for a AAA arbitration. Your right to a hearing will be determined by the
                    AAA Rules.

           (g) Exceptions to Arbitration.
          </h5>
          <p>
           This Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following types of
                    claims: (1) small claims actions brought on an individual basis that are within the
                    scope of such small claims court’s jurisdiction; (2) a representative action
                    brought on behalf of others under PAGA or other private attorneys general acts, to
                    the extent the representative PAGA Waiver in Section 17(c) of such action is deemed
                    unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction under applicable law not
                    preempted by the FAA; (3) claims for workers’ compensation, state disability
                    insurance and unemployment insurance benefits; (4) claims that may not be
                    subject to arbitration as a matter of generally applicable law not preempted by the
                    FAA; and (5) individual claims of sexual assault or sexual harassment in connection
                    with the use of the Lyft Platform or Rideshare Services. Where these claims are
                    brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, Lyft will not require arbitration of
                    those claims. Lyft's agreement not to require arbitration of these claims does not
                    waive the enforceability of any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement
                    (including without limitation the waivers provided in Section 17(b)), or of the
                    enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement as to any other dispute, claim, or
                    controversy.

                    (“NLRB”), or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, or similar local,
                    state or federal agency, and nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed
                    to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any
                    agency in order to fulfill the party's obligation to exhaust administrative
                    remedies before making a claim in arbitration  However, should you bring an
                    administrative claim, you may only seek or recover money damages of any type
                    pursuant to this Arbitration Provision, and you knowingly and voluntarily waive the
                    right to seek or recover money damages of any type pursuant to any administrative
                    complaint, except for a complaint issued by the NLRB.  Should you participate in an
                    NLRB proceeding, you may only recover money damages if such recovery does not arise
                    from or relate to a claim previously adjudicated under this Arbitration Provision
                    or settled by you.  Similarly, you may not recover money damages under this
                    Arbitration Provision if you have already adjudicated such claim with the NLRB.
                    Nothing in this Agreement or Arbitration Agreement prevents your participation in
                    an investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise
                    covered by this Arbitration Provision.

                    the event  that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or
                    unenforceable  under applicable law not preempted by the FAA, such provision
                    shall be severed and  the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given

                    Settlement Action.
          </h5>
          <p>
           As a Driver or Driver applicant, you may opt out of the requirement to arbitrate
                    Driver Claims defined in Section 17(e)(3) (except as limited by Section 17(i)
                    above) pursuant to the terms of this subsection if you have not previously
                    agreed to an arbitration provision in Lyft’s Terms of Service where you had the
                    opportunity to opt out of the requirement to arbitrate. If you have previously
                    agreed to such an arbitration provision, you may opt out of any revisions to
                    your prior arbitration agreement made by this provision in the manner specified
                    below, but opting out of this arbitration provision has no effect on any
                    previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with Lyft.
                    If you have not previously agreed to such an arbitration provision and do not
                    wish to be subject to this Arbitration Agreement with respect to Driver Claims,
                    you may opt out of arbitration with respect to such Driver Claims, other than
                    those in a Pending Settlement Action, by notifying Lyft in writing of your
                    desire to opt out of arbitration for such Driver Claims, which writing must be
                    dated, signed and delivered by electronic mail to arbitrationoptout@lyft.com.
          </p>
          <p>
           In order to be effective, (A) the writing must clearly indicate your intent to
                    opt out of this Arbitration Agreement with respect to Driver Claims that are
                    not part of a Pending Settlement Action, (B) the writing must include the name,
                    phone number, and email address associated with your User Account, and (C) the
                    email containing the signed writing must be sent within 30 days of  the date
                    this Agreement is executed by you. Should you not opt out within the  30-day
                    period, you and Lyft shall be bound by the terms of this Arbitration  Agreement
                    in full (including with respect to Driver Claims that are not part of  a Pending
                    Settlement Action). As provided in paragraph 17(i) above, any opt out  that you
                    submit shall not apply to any Driver Claims that are part of a Pending
                    Settlement Action and your Driver Claims in any such Pending Settlement Action
                    shall continue to be governed by the arbitration provisions that are contained
                    in the applicable Lyft Terms of Use that you agreed to prior to the effective

           Cases have been filed against Lyft and may be filed in the future involving
                    Driver Claims. You should assume that there are now, and may be in the future,
                    lawsuits against Lyft alleging class, collective, and/or representative Driver
                    Claims in which the plaintiffs seek to act on your behalf, and which, if
                    successful, could result in some monetary recovery to you. But if you do agree
                    to arbitration of Driver Claims with Lyft under this Arbitration Agreement, you
                    are agreeing in advance that you will bring all such claims, and seek all
                    monetary and other relief, against Lyft in an individual arbitration,  except
                    for the Driver Claims that are part of a Pending Settlement Action. You  are
                    also agreeing in advance that you will not participate in, or seek to  recover
                    monetary or other relief, for such claims in any court action or class,
                    collective, and/or representative action. You have the right to consult with
                    counsel of your choice concerning this Arbitration Agreement and you will not
                    be subject to retaliation if you exercise your right to assert claims or opt-
                    out of any Driver Claims under this Arbitration Agreement.

           (k) Optional Pre-Arbitration Negotiation Process.
          </h5>
          <p>
           Before initiating any arbitration or proceeding, you and Lyft may agree to
                    first attempt to negotiate any dispute, claim or controversy between the
                    parties informally for 30 days, unless this time period is mutually extended by
                    you and Lyft. A party who intends to seek negotiation under this subsection
                    must first send to the other a written notice of the dispute (“Notice”). The
                    Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2)
                    set forth the specific relief sought. All offers, promises, conduct and
                    statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the negotiation by
                    any of the parties, their agents, employees, and attorneys are confidential,
                    privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including as evidence of liability

                    information about a User made available to you in connection with such User’s use
                    of the Platform, which may include the User’s name, pick-up location, contact
                    information and photo (“Confidential Information”) disclosed to you by Lyft for
                    your own use or for any purpose other than as contemplated herein. You shall not
                    disclose or permit disclosure of any Confidential Information to third parties,
                    and you agree not to store separate and outside of the Lyft Platform any User
                    Information obtained from the Lyft Platform. As a Driver, you understand that some
                    of Rider Information you receive may be protected by federal and/or state
                    confidentiality laws, such as the Health Information Portability and Accountability
                    Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), governing the privacy and security of protected (patient)
                    health information. In the event that you know a Rider, you should not disclose
                    to anyone the identity of the Rider or the location that you picked up, or dropped
                    of the Rider as this could violate HIPAA. You understand that any violation of the
                    Agreement's confidentiality provisions may violate HIPAA or state confidentiality
                    laws and could result in civil or criminal penalties against you. You agree to
                    take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure
                    or use of Confidential Information of Lyft in order to prevent it from
                    falling into the public domain. Notwithstanding the above, you shall not have
                    liability to Lyft with regard to any Confidential Information which you can prove:
                    was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed by Lyft or has entered the
                    public domain through no fault of yours; was known to you, without restriction, at
                    the time of disclosure, as demonstrated by files in existence at the time of
                    disclosure; is disclosed with the prior written approval of Lyft; becomes known to
                    you, without restriction, from a source other than Lyft without breach of this
                    Agreement by you and otherwise not in violation of Lyft’s rights; or is disclosed
                    pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other
                    governmental body; provided, however, that You shall provide prompt notice of such
                    court order or requirement to Lyft to enable Lyft to seek a protective order or
                    otherwise prevent or restrict such disclosure.

           Lyft does not, and shall not be deemed to, direct or control you generally or

                    clothing displaying Lyft’s names, logos or colors. You acknowledge and agree

                    binding, the parties shall remain bound by all other provisions of this Agreement.
                    In that event, the parties shall replace the invalid or non-binding provision with

             Location Information

            . Lyft is all about connecting
                        Drivers and Riders. To do this, we need to know where you are. When
                        you open Lyft on your mobile device, we receive your location. We may
                        also collect the precise location of your device when the app is
                        running in the foreground or background. If you label certain
                        locations, such as “home” and “work,” we receive that information,
                        too.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your location information is necessary for things like matching Riders
                        with nearby Drivers, determining drop off and pick up locations, and
                        suggesting destinations based on previous trips. Also, if the need
                        ever arises, our Trust &amp; Safety team may use and share location
                        information to help protect the safety of Lyft Users or a member of
                        the public. In addition to the reasons described above, Drivers’
                        location information and distance travelled is necessary for
                        calculating charges and insurance for Lyft rides. If you give us
                        permission through your device settings or Lyft app, we may collect
                        your location while the app is off to identify promotions or service
                        updates in your area.

                        Drivers who have been connected for a ride. We receive information
                        about these communications including the date and time of the call or
                        SMS message, the parties’ phone numbers, and the content of any SMS
                        messages.  For security purposes, we may also monitor and/or record
                        the contents of phone calls made on the Lyft Platform, such as those
                        between Riders and Drivers.  You will be given notice that your call
                        may be recorded, and by proceeding you agree to allow Lyft to monitor
                        and/or record your call.

             User Feedback

            . At Lyft, we want to make sure Users
                        are always enjoying great rides. Riders and Drivers may rate and
                        review each other at the end of every ride. We receive information
                        about ratings and reviews and, as we explain below, give Riders
                        information about Drivers’ ratings and reviews and vice versa.

            <strong>
             Sharing between Riders and Drivers
            </strong>
            . Riders and Drivers that
                        have been matched for a ride are able to see basic information about
                        each other, such as names, photo, ratings, and any information they
                        have added to their Profiles. Riders and Drivers who connect their
                        Lyft accounts to Facebook will also be able to see their mutual
                        Facebook friends during the ride. Drivers see the pick-up location
                        that the Rider has provided. Riders see a Driver’s vehicle information
                        and real-time location as the Driver approaches the pick-up location.
                        Riders’ ratings of Drivers are shared with Drivers on a weekly basis.
                        We de-identify the ratings and feedback, but we can’t rule out that a
                        driver may be able to identify the Rider that provided the rating or
                        feedback.
           </p>
           <p>
            Although we help Riders and Drivers communicate with one another to
                        arrange a pickup, we do not share your actual phone number or other
                        contact information with other Users.  If you report a lost or found
                        item to us, we will seek to connect you with the relevant Rider or
                        Driver, including sharing actual contact information with your
                        permission.

            <strong>
             Sharing between Lyft Line Riders
            </strong>
            . If you use Lyft
                        Line, Riders who have been matched with you will be able to see your
                        name, photo and any information you have added to your Profile. If you
                        connect your Lyft account to Facebook (such as by signing up through
                        Facebook), we may show your mutual friends with other Riders who are
                        also connected via Facebook.  During the Lyft Line matching process we
                        may show photos of possible matches to you and other Riders.

                        don’t have control over (for example, we may give you the ability to
                        order a food delivery from a restaurant from within the Lyft app). If
                        you use these services, we will provide the third party with
                        information about you to allow them to provide the service to you (for
                        example, we would give the restaurant your name, phone number and
                        address to drop off the food).  We can’t speak to the privacy
                        practices of these third parties, and we encourage you to read their

             Enterprise Partners

                        enterprise program and charge a ride to your organization’s billing
                        method or credits, we will provide your organization’s account holder
                        with information about your use of the Lyft Platform, including ride
                        details such as date, time, charge, and pick up and drop off
                        locations. If you create a Business Profile, at the end of each ride
                        you will have the option to designate the ride as a business ride. If
                        you do so, and your organization has a corporate account with Lyft, we
                        may share information about your use of Lyft Platform with your
                        organization including ride details such as date, time, charge, and

                        responsibility to update your Business Profile with the new
                        information.  (Please remember to check and set your designation

            .  We’ve partnered with several
                        ride-sharing services around the globe so Riders can continue to find
                        rides when they open the Lyft app abroad, and Drivers can provide
                        services to international travelers in the U.S.  When we match a ride
                        with the partner, we share the same information that is shared between
                        matched Riders and Drivers on the Lyft Platform. In some cases we are
                        unable to mask your phone number if you call an international driver,
                        so please keep that in mind before using this feature.

           . You can always unsubscribe from our
                    commercial or promotional emails but we will still send you transactional
                    and relational emails about your account use of the Lyft Platform.

            Text Messages
           </strong>
           . You can opt out of receiving commercial or
                    promotional text messages by texting the word END to 46080 from the mobile
                    device receiving the messages.  You may also opt out of receiving all
                    texts from Lyft (including transactional or relational messages) by
                    texting the word STOPALL to 46080 from the mobile device receiving the
                    messages, however, opting out of receiving all texts may impact your use
                    of the Lyft Platform.  Drivers can also opt out of driver-specific
                    messages by texting STOP in response to a driver SMS.  To re-enable texts
                    you can text START in response to an unsubscribe confirmation SMS.

           </strong>
           .  You can opt out of receiving push
                    notifications through your device settings.  Please note that opting out
                    of receiving push notifications may impact your use of the Lyft Platform
                    (such as receiving a notification that your ride has arrived).

           <strong>
            Profile Information
           </strong>
           . While your name will always be
                    shared with Drivers and fellow Lyft Line Riders, you can delete any
                    additional information that you added to your Profile at any time if you
                    don’t want Drivers and Lyft Line Riders to see it. Riders will always be
                    able to see Drivers’ names, rating, profile photos, and vehicle
                    information.

            Location Information

                    from sharing location information at any time through your Device’s
                    operating system settings, Rider and Driver location is core to the Lyft
                    Platform and without it we can’t provide our services to you.

            Editing and Accessing Your Information
           </strong>
           . You can review
                    and edit certain account information by logging in to your account
                    settings and profile (Drivers may edit additional information through the

                    our practices under this Privacy Policy for accounts that are not closed.
                    We also may retain information from your account to collect any fees owed,
                    resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, analyze usage of the Lyft
