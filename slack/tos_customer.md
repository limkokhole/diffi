**Effective: January 31, 2018**

These Customer Terms of Service (the “**Customer Terms**”) describe your rights and responsibilities when using our online workplace productivity tools and platform (the “**Services**”). Please read them carefully. If you are a Customer (defined below), these Customer Terms govern your access and use of our Services. If you are being invited to a workspace set up by a Customer, the [User Terms of Service](https://slack.com/terms-of-service/user) (the “**User Terms**”) govern your access and use of the Services. We are grateful you’re here.

## First Things First

### These “Customer Terms” Form a Part of a Binding “Contract”

These Customer Terms (or, if applicable, your written agreement with us) and any Order Form(s) (defined below) together form a binding “**Contract**” between Customer and us. If any terms in the [Customer-Specific Supplement](https://slack.com/terms-of-service/supplement) apply to Customer (e.g., if Customer is a U.S. government entity), those terms are also incorporated herein by reference and form part of the Contract. “We,” “our” and “us” refers to the applicable Slack entity in the section entitled “Which Slack Entity is Customer Contracting With?” below.

### Your Agreement On Behalf of “Customer”

If you purchase subscription(s), create a workspace (i.e., a digital space where a group of users may access the Services, as further described in our Help Center pages), invite users to that workspace, or use or allow use of that workspace after being notified of a change to these Customer Terms, you acknowledge your understanding of the then-current Contract and agree to the Contract on behalf of Customer. Please make sure you have the necessary authority to enter into the Contract on behalf of Customer before proceeding.

## Customer Choices and Instructions

### Who is “Customer”? (Hint: There can be only one)

“Customer” is the organization that you represent in agreeing to the Contract. If your workspace is being set up by someone who is not formally affiliated with an organization, Customer is the individual creating the workspace. For example, if you signed up using a personal email address and invited a couple of friends to work on a new startup idea but haven't formed a company yet, you are the Customer.

### Signing Up Using a Corporate Email Domain

If you signed up for a plan using your corporate email domain, your organization is Customer, and Customer can modify and re-assign roles on your workspace (including your role) and otherwise exercise its rights under the Contract. If Customer elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the workspace, we will provide you with notice following such election and you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or Customer to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of Customer.

### What This Means for Customer—and for Us

Individuals authorized by Customer to access the Services (an “**Authorized User**”) may submit content or information to the Services, such as messages or files (“**Customer Data**”), and Customer may exclusively provide us with instructions on what to do with it. For example, Customer may provision or deprovision access to the Services, enable or disable third party integrations, manage permissions, retention and export settings, transfer or assign workspaces, share channels, or consolidate workspaces or channels with other workspaces or channels. Since these choices and instructions may result in the access, use, disclosure, modification or deletion of certain or all Customer Data, please review the [Help Center](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/categories/200122103-team-administration) pages for more information about these choices and instructions.

Customer will (a) inform Authorized Users of all Customer policies and practices that are relevant to their use of the Services and of any settings that may impact the processing of Customer Data; and (b) ensure the transfer and processing of Customer Data under the Contract is lawful.

### Ordering Subscriptions

A subscription allows an Authorized User to access the Services. No matter the role, a subscription is required for each Authorized User. A subscription may be procured through the Services interface, or in some cases, via an order form entered into between Customer and us (each, an “**Order Form**”). Please see the [Help Center](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/categories/200122103-team-administration) for more information on procuring subscriptions and inviting new Authorized Users. Each Authorized User must agree to the User Terms
