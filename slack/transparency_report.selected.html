  At Slack we are committed to trust and transparency. As part of this commitment, we publish periodic reports about requests for data by law enforcement and governmental entities. The latest report is below and covers all such requests received from May 1 through December 31, 2018. Please note that this period covers more time than previous reports published. We’re moving to an annual cadence of reporting on these matters to coincide with the year end. More information about our policies and practices with respect to data (including definitions of terms not defined herein)  can be found in the
