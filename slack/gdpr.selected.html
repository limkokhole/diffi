  Our Commitment to You and the Protection of Your Data
 </h2>
 <p>
  We’re committed to helping Slack customers and users understand, and where applicable, comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR is the most comprehensive EU data privacy law in decades, and went into effect on May 25, 2018.
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides strengthening and standardizing user data privacy across the EU nations, it  introduces new or additional obligations on all organizations that handle EU citizens’ personal data, regardless of where the organizations are located. On this page, we explain how we help our customers comply with the GDPR.

  Our Security Infrastructure and Certifications
