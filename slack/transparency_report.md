At Slack we care deeply about maintaining the trust of our customers, as well as  being as transparent as possible about government and third party requests for Customer data.  As a part of this commitment, we publish periodic reports about requests for data by law enforcement and governmental entities. The latest report is below and covers all such requests from January 1 - December 31, 2019. More information about our policies and practices with respect to data (including definitions of terms not defined herein) can be found in the [Slack Terms of Service](https://slack.com/terms-of-service), [Privacy Policy](https://slack.com/privacy-policy), [Security Practices](https://slack.com/security-practices) and [Data Request Policy](https://slack.com/user-data-request-policy).

In addition to our commitment to trust and transparency, we also believe in the importance of fundamental privacy protection of user data, constitutional guardrails and judicial oversight of government data collection and surveillance.

## We abide by the following Guiding Principles:
- We are committed to maintaining Customer privacy and confidentiality- All legal process is carefully reviewed. Slack rejects or challenges any requests that have no legal basis or are unclear, overbroad, or otherwise inappropriate. - Slack construes legal process as narrowly as possible.- Wherever possible we encourage Customers and third parties to obtain relevant data without our intervention
