                <ul>
                 <li>
                  User profile: We collect data when users create or update their Uber accounts. This may include their name, email, phone number, login name and password, address, profile picture, payment or banking information (including related payment verification information), government identification documents, including driver’s license numbers and images, birthdate, signature, and photo. This also includes vehicle or insurance information of drivers and delivery partners, and user settings. We may use the photos submitted by drivers and/or delivery partners to verify their identities, such as through facial recognition technologies. For more information, please see the section titled “How we use personal data.”

                 <li>
                  Background check and identity verification: We collect background check and identity verification information for drivers and delivery partners. This may include information such as driver history or criminal record (where permitted by law), and right to work. This information may be collected by an authorized vendor on Uber’s behalf. We also collect identity verification from Uber Eats users who request alcohol delivery.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  Demographic data: We may collect demographic data about users, including through user surveys. In some countries, we may also receive demographic data about users from third parties.

                 <li>

                <ul>
                 <li>
                  Location data: We collect precise or approximate location data from a user’s mobile device if enabled by the user to do so. For drivers and delivery partners, Uber collects this data when the Uber app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) or background (app open but not on-screen) of their mobile device. For riders, delivery recipients, and renters, Uber collects this data when the Uber app is running in the foreground. In certain regions (which do not include the European Union), Uber may also collect this data when the Uber app is running in the background of the user’s mobile device. Riders, delivery recipients, and renters may use the Uber apps without enabling Uber to collect location data from their mobile devices. However, this may affect some functionality available in the Uber apps. For example, a user who has not enabled location data collection will have to manually enter their address. In addition, the location data collected from a driver or rental device during a trip will be linked to the rider’s or renter’s account, even if they have not enabled location data to be collected from their device, including for purposes of receipt generation, customer support, fraud detection, insurance, and litigation.

Additionally, if someone uses your promotion code, we may associate your name with that person.

To provide this service, Uber receives some data regarding the calls, texts, or other communications, including the date and time of the communications and the content of the communications. Uber may also use this data for customer support services (including to resolve disputes between users), for safety and security purposes, to improve our products and services, and for analytics.

                </p>
                <ul>
                 <li>
                  Screening riders, drivers, and delivery partners before enabling their use of our services and at subsequent intervals, including through reviews of background checks, where permitted by law, to help prevent use of our services by unsafe drivers and/or riders.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  Using data from drivers’ or delivery partners’ devices to help identify unsafe driving behavior such as speeding or harsh braking and acceleration, and to inform them of safer driving practices. We also use data from delivery partners’ devices to verify the type of vehicles they used to provide deliveries.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  In certain regions, using information derived from driver’s license photos, and other photos submitted to Uber, for safety and security purposes. This includes Uber’s Real-Time ID Check feature, which prompts drivers and delivery partners to share a selfie before going online to help ensure that the driver or delivery partner using the app matches the Uber account we have on file. This also includes comparing photographs that we have on file against photographs (i) of other users to prevent identity-borrowing, and (ii) from public databases to verify user identity.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  Using device, location, profile, usage, and other data to prevent, detect, and combat fraud or unsafe activities.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  Using user ratings and feedback to encourage compliance with our
                  <a href="https://www.uber.com/legal/community-guidelines/us-en/">
                   Community Guidelines
                  </a>
                  and as grounds for deactivating drivers and delivery partners with low ratings or who otherwise violated such guidelines in certain countries.
                 </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                 3. Customer support. Uber uses the information we collect (including recordings of customer support calls with notice to and the consent of the user) to provide customer support, including to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                 <li>
                  Direct questions to the appropriate customer support person
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  Investigate and address user concerns

                  Monitor and improve our customer support responses and processes
                 </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                 4. Research and development. We may use the data we collect for testing, research, analysis, product development, and machine learning to improve the user experience. This helps us to improve and enhance the safety and security of our services, improve our ability to prevent the use of our services for illegal or improper purposes, develop new features and products, and facilitate insurance and finance solutions in connection with our services.
                </p>
                <p>
                 5. Enabling communications between users. For example, a driver may message or call a rider to confirm a pickup location, a rider may contact a driver to retrieve a lost item, or a restaurant or delivery partner may call a delivery recipient with information about their order.
                </p>
                <p>
                 6. Marketing. Uber may use the data we collect to market our services to our users. This includes sending users communications about Uber services, features, promotions, sweepstakes, studies, surveys, news, updates, and events.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We may also send communications to our users about products and services offered by Uber partners. For example, if a user has placed an Uber Eats order, we may provide recommendations, promotions, or ads about similar food offered by other Uber partners. Although we may send users communications about Uber partners’ products and services, we do not sell users’ personal data to, or share it with, such partners or others for purposes of their own direct marketing or advertising, except with users’ consent.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We may use the data we collect to personalize the marketing communications (including advertisements) that we send, including based on user location, past use of Uber’s services, and user preferences and settings.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We may also send users communications regarding elections, ballots, referenda, and other political and notice processes that relate to our services. For example, Uber has notified some users by email of ballot measures or pending legislation relating to the availability of Uber’s services in those users’ areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                 7. Non-marketing communications. Uber may use the data we collect to generate and provide users with receipts; inform them of changes to our terms, services, or policies; or send other communications that aren’t for the purpose of marketing the services or products of Uber or its partners.
                </p>
                <p>
                 8. Legal proceedings and requirements. We may use the personal data we collect to investigate or address claims or disputes relating to use of Uber’s services, or as otherwise allowed by applicable law, or as requested by regulators, government entities, and official inquiries.
                </p>
                <p>
                 9. Automated decision-making
                </p>
                <p>
                 We use personal data to make automated decisions relating to use of our services. This includes:

                  Deactivating users who are identified as having engaged in fraud or activities that may otherwise harm Uber, its users, and others. In some cases, such as when a user is determined to be abusing Uber’s referral program, such behavior may result in automatic deactivation.

                 <li>
                  Using driver location information, and communications between riders and drivers, to identify cancellation fees earned or induced through fraud. For example, if we determine by using such information that a driver is delaying a rider pickup in order to induce a cancellation, we will not charge the rider a cancellation fee and will adjust the amounts paid to the driver to omit such a fee. To object to such adjustment, please contact Uber customer support.

                <p>
                 We share data with our subsidiaries and affiliates to help us provide our services or conduct data processing on our behalf. For example, Uber processes and stores data in the United States on behalf of its international subsidiaries and affiliates.

                <p>
                 Uber may share users’ personal data if we believe it’s required by applicable law, regulation, operating license or agreement, legal process or governmental request, or where the disclosure is otherwise appropriate due to safety or similar concerns. This includes sharing personal data with law enforcement officials, public health officials, other government authorities, airports (if required by the airport authorities as a condition of operating on airport property), or other third parties as necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, user agreements, or other policies; to protect Uber’s rights or property or the rights, safety, or property of others; or in the event of a claim or dispute relating to the use of our services. If you use another person’s credit card, we may be required by law to share your personal data, including trip or order information, with the owner of that credit card.

                 . Following such requests, Uber deletes the data that it is not required to retain for purposes of regulatory, tax, insurance, litigation, or other legal requirements. For example, Uber retains location, device, and usage data for these purposes for a minimum of 7 years; while it retains such data, it may also use it for purposes of safety, security, fraud prevention and detection, and research and development. In certain circumstances, Uber may be unable to delete a user’s account, such as if there’s an outstanding credit on the account or an unresolved claim or dispute. Upon resolution of the issue preventing deletion, Uber will delete the account as described above.

                <p>
                 Uber may also retain certain information if necessary for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention. For example, if Uber deactivates a user’s account because of unsafe behavior or security incidents, Uber may retain certain information about that account to prevent that user from opening a new Uber account in the future.

                <ul>
                 <li>

                <p>
                 This includes using personal data to maintain and enhance our users’ safety and security. For example, we use personal data to prevent use of our services by users who have engaged in inappropriate or dangerous behavior, such as by retaining data of banned users to prevent their use of Uber’s apps. We also use usage data to prevent matching of riders and drivers for whom there is higher risk of conflict (for instance, because they have been the subject of prior complaints from other users).
                </p>

                <p>
                 In addition, it includes using personal data to the extent necessary for the interests of other people or the general public, such as in connection with legal or insurance claims, and to protect the rights and safety of others.

                </p>
                <p>
                 For example, Uber is subject to laws and regulations in many cities and countries that require it to collect and retain data about our users’ trips, and to provide copies of such data to the government or other authorities. We collect and use personal data to comply with such laws.

                </p>
                <p>
                 Settings menus in the Uber app for riders give them the ability to set or update their location-sharing preferences and their preferences for receiving mobile notifications from Uber. Information about these settings, how to set or change these settings, and the effect of turning off these settings is described below.
                </p>
                <ul>
                 <li>
                  Location data
                 </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                 Uber uses riders’ device location services to make it easier to get a ride whenever they need one. Location data helps improve our services, including pickups, navigation, and customer support.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Riders may enable or disallow Uber to collect location data from their mobile devices through the Settings &gt; Privacy menus in the Uber app. Riders and delivery recipients can enable or disallow such collections through the settings on their mobile device.
                </p>

                 <li>

                 </li>

                <p>
                 Riders who have enabled Uber to collect location data from their mobile device may also enable Uber to share their location with their driver from the time the ride is requested to the start of the trip. This can help improve pickups for both drivers and riders, particularly in crowded areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Riders may enable or disable this feature through the Settings &gt; Privacy menus in the Uber app.

                <p>
                 Riders who have enabled Uber to collect location data from their mobile device may also enable the Emergency Data Sharing feature that shares data with emergency police, fire, and ambulance services. Such data includes approximate location at the time the emergency call was placed; the car’s make, model, color, and license plate information; the rider’s name and phone number; pickup and dropoff locations; and the driver’s name.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Riders may enable or disable this feature through the Settings &gt; Privacy menus or the Safety Center in the Uber app.

                <p>
                 Uber provides users with trip status notifications and updates related to activity on their account. These notifications are a necessary part of using the Uber app and cannot be disabled. However, users may choose the method by which they receive these notifications through the Settings &gt; Privacy menus in the Uber app.

                <p>
                 Users may enable Uber to send push notifications about discounts and news from Uber. Push notifications may be enabled or disabled through the Settings &gt; Privacy menus in the Uber app.

                <p>
                 Delivery recipients who have opted in to communications from restaurant partners may stop sharing their data with each restaurant partner in their Uber Eats account settings.

                 B. Device permissions
                </p>
                <p>
                 Most mobile device platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without the device owner’s permission, and these platforms have different methods for how that permission can be obtained. iOS devices notify users the first time the Uber app requests permission to access certain types of data and gives users the option to grant or refuse permission. Android devices notify users of the permissions that the Uber app seeks before their first use of the app, and use of the app constitutes a grant of such permission.
                </p>
                <p>
                 C. Ratings look-up
                </p>
                <p>
                 After every trip, drivers and riders are able to rate each other on a scale from 1 to 5. An average of those ratings is associated with a user’s account and is displayed to other users for whom they provide or receive services. For example, rider ratings are available to drivers from whom they request transportation, and driver ratings are available to their riders.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This 2-way system holds everyone accountable for their behavior. Accountability helps create a respectful, safe environment for drivers and riders. Riders can see their average rating in the main menu of the Uber app. Drivers can see their average rating after tapping their profile photo in the Uber Driver app.
                </p>
