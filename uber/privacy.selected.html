This also includes vehicle or insurance information of drivers and delivery partners, and user settings.
We may use the photos submitted by drivers and/or delivery partners to verify their identities, such as through facial recognition technologies. For more information, please see the section titled “<strong class="cmln__strong">How we use personal data.</strong>”</li>
</ul>
<ul class="cmln__list"><li class="cmln__list-item"><strong class="cmln__strong">Background check and identity verification</strong>: We collect background check and identity verification information for drivers and delivery partners.

<ul class="cmln__list"><li class="cmln__list-item"><strong class="cmln__strong">Location data</strong>: We collect precise or approximate location data from a user’s mobile device if enabled by the user to do so. For drivers and delivery partners, Uber collects this data when the Uber app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) or background (app open but not on-screen) of their mobile device. For riders, delivery recipients, and renters, Uber collects this data when the Uber app is running in the foreground. In certain regions (which do not include the European Union), Uber may also collect this data when the Uber app is running in the background of the user’s mobile device. Riders, delivery recipients, and renters may use the Uber apps without enabling Uber to collect location data from their mobile devices. However, this may affect some functionality available in the Uber apps. For example, a user who has not enabled location data collection will have to manually enter their address. In addition, the location data collected from a driver or rental device during a trip will be linked to the rider’s or renter’s account, even if they have not enabled location data to be collected from their device, including for purposes of receipt generation, customer support, fraud detection, insurance, and litigation. </li>

</ul>
<ul class="cmln__list"><li class="cmln__list-item"><strong class="cmln__strong">Communications data</strong>: We enable users to communicate with each other and Uber through Uber’s mobile apps and websites. For example, we enable drivers and riders, and restaurants or delivery partners and delivery recipients, to call, text, or send other files to each other (generally without disclosing their telephone numbers to each other). To provide this service, Uber receives some data regarding the calls, texts, or other communications, including the date and time of the communications and the content of the communications.

For example, if Uber deactivates a user’s account because of unsafe behavior or security incidents, Uber may retain certain information about that account to prevent that user from opening a new Uber account in the future.</p>

<p class="cmln__paragraph"><strong class="cmln__strong">a. To provide requested services and features</strong></p>
<p class="cmln__paragraph">In order to provide our services, we must collect and use certain personal data. This includes: </p>
<ul class="cmln__list"><li class="cmln__list-item"><p class="cmln__paragraph">User profile data, which we use to establish and maintain user accounts; verify user identity; communicate with users about their trips, orders, and accounts; and enable users to make payments or receive earnings </p>
</li>
<li class="cmln__list-item"><p class="cmln__paragraph">Background trip information, which is used to verify an applicant’s eligibility to be a driver or delivery partner</p>
</li>
<li class="cmln__list-item"><p class="cmln__paragraph">Driver and delivery partner location data, which we use to track trips and assist with navigation</p>
</li>
<li class="cmln__list-item"><p class="cmln__paragraph">Usage data, which is necessary to maintain, optimize, and enhance Uber’s services, including to determine incentives, connect riders and drivers, and calculate costs of trips and driver earnings</p>
</li>
<li class="cmln__list-item">Transaction information</li>
<li class="cmln__list-item">Information relating to customer support </li>
</ul>
<p class="cmln__paragraph"><strong class="cmln__strong">b. For purposes of the legitimate interests of Uber or other parties</strong></p>
<p class="cmln__paragraph">This includes using personal data to maintain and enhance our users’ safety and security. For example, we use personal data to prevent use of our services by users who have engaged in inappropriate or dangerous behavior, such as by retaining data of banned users to prevent their use of Uber’s apps. We also use usage data to prevent matching of riders and drivers for whom there is higher risk of conflict (for instance, because they have been the subject of prior complaints from other users). </p>
<p class="cmln__paragraph">This also includes purposes such as combating fraud; improving our services, direct marketing, research, and development; and enforcing Uber’s Terms of Service.</p>
<p class="cmln__paragraph">In addition, it includes using personal data to the extent necessary for the interests of other people or the general public, such as in connection with legal or insurance claims, and to protect the rights and safety of others.</p>
<p class="cmln__paragraph"><strong class="cmln__strong">c. To fulfill Uber’s legal obligations</strong></p>
<p class="cmln__paragraph">For example, Uber is subject to laws and regulations in many cities and countries that require it to collect and retain data about our users’ trips, and to provide copies of such data to the government or other authorities. We collect and use personal data to comply with such laws. </p>
<p class="cmln__paragraph">Uber may also share data with law enforcement regarding criminal acts or threats to public safety, or requests by third parties pursuant to legal processes. For more information about such sharing, please see Uber’s <a class="cmln__link" href="https://www.uber.com/legal/data-requests/guidelines-for-law-enforcement-united-states/en-US/">Guidelines for Law Enforcement Authorities - United States</a>, <a class="cmln__link" href="https://www.uber.com/legal/data-requests/guidelines-for-law-enforcement-outside-the-united-states/en/">Guidelines for Law Enforcement Authorities - Outside the US</a>, and <a class="cmln__link" href="https://www.uber.com/legal/data-requests/guidelines-for-third-party-data-requests/en/">Guidelines for Third Party Data Requests and Service of Legal Documents</a>.</p>
<p class="cmln__paragraph"><strong class="cmln__strong">d. With consent</strong></p>
<p class="cmln__paragraph">Uber may collect and use personal data based on the user’s consent. For example, we may collect personal data through voluntary surveys. Responses to such surveys are collected on the basis of consent and will be deleted once no longer necessary for the purposes collected. </p>
<p class="cmln__paragraph">A user who has provided consent to a collection or use of their personal data can revoke it at any time. However, the user will not be able to use any service or feature that requires collection or use of that personal data.</p>

Privacy settings</strong></p>
<p class="cmln__paragraph">Settings menus in the Uber app for riders give them the ability to set or update their location-sharing preferences and their preferences for receiving mobile notifications from Uber. Information about these settings, how to set or change these settings, and the effect of turning off these settings is described below. </p>
<ul class="cmln__list"><li class="cmln__list-item"><strong class="cmln__strong">Location data</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="cmln__paragraph">Uber uses riders’ device location services to make it easier to get a ride whenever they need one. Location data helps improve our services, including pickups, navigation, and customer support. </p>
<p class="cmln__paragraph">Riders may enable or disallow Uber to collect location data from their mobile devices through the Settings &gt; Privacy menus in the Uber app. Riders and delivery recipients can enable or disallow such collections through the settings on their mobile device. </p>
<ul class="cmln__list"><li class="cmln__list-item"><strong class="cmln__strong">Share Live Location (riders)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="cmln__paragraph">Riders who have enabled Uber to collect location data from their mobile device may also enable Uber to share their location with their driver from the time the ride is requested to the start of the trip. This can help improve pickups for both drivers and riders, particularly in crowded areas.</p>
<p class="cmln__paragraph">Riders may enable or disable this feature through the Settings &gt; Privacy menus in the Uber app.</p>
<ul class="cmln__list"><li class="cmln__list-item"><strong class="cmln__strong">Emergency Data Sharing (riders)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="cmln__paragraph">Riders who have enabled Uber to collect location data from their mobile device may also enable the Emergency Data Sharing feature that shares data with emergency police, fire, and ambulance services. Such data includes approximate location at the time the emergency call was placed; the car’s make, model, color, and license plate information; the rider’s name and phone number; pickup and dropoff locations; and the driver’s name.</p>
<p class="cmln__paragraph">Riders may enable or disable this feature through the Settings &gt; Privacy menus or the Safety Center in the Uber app.</p>
<ul class="cmln__list"><li class="cmln__list-item"><strong class="cmln__strong">Notifications: account and trip updates</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="cmln__paragraph">Uber provides users with trip status notifications and updates related to activity on their account. These notifications are a necessary part of using the Uber app and cannot be disabled. However, users may choose the method by which they receive these notifications through the Settings &gt; Privacy menus in the Uber app.</p>
<ul class="cmln__list"><li class="cmln__list-item"><strong class="cmln__strong">Notifications: discounts and news</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="cmln__paragraph">Users may enable Uber to send push notifications about discounts and news from Uber. Push notifications may be enabled or disabled through the Settings &gt; Privacy menus in the Uber app.</p>
<ul class="cmln__list"><li class="cmln__list-item"><strong class="cmln__strong">Communications from restaurant partners</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="cmln__paragraph">Delivery recipients who have opted in to communications from restaurant partners may stop sharing their data with each restaurant partner in their Uber Eats account settings. </p>
<p class="cmln__paragraph"><strong class="cmln__strong">B. Device permissions</strong></p>
<p class="cmln__paragraph">Most mobile device platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without the device owner’s permission, and these platforms have different methods for how that permission can be obtained. iOS devices notify users the first time the Uber app requests permission to access certain types of data and gives users the option to grant or refuse permission. Android devices notify users of the permissions that the Uber app seeks before their first use of the app, and use of the app constitutes a grant of such permission.</p>
<p class="cmln__paragraph"><strong class="cmln__strong">C. Ratings look-up</strong></p>
<p class="cmln__paragraph">After every trip, drivers and riders are able to rate each other on a scale from 1 to 5. An average of those ratings is associated with a user’s account and is displayed to other users for whom they provide or receive services. For example, rider ratings are available to drivers from whom they request transportation, and driver ratings are available to their riders. </p>
<p class="cmln__paragraph">This 2-way system holds everyone accountable for their behavior. Accountability helps create a respectful, safe environment for drivers and riders. 
Riders can see their average rating in the main menu of the Uber app. 
Drivers can see their average rating after tapping their profile photo in the Uber Driver app.</p>
<p class="cmln__paragraph">Delivery partners are also rated by delivery recipients and restaurant partners. Click <a class="cmln__link" href="https://help.uber.com/partners/article/how-do-delivery-ratings-work?nodeId=7671ae08-cf2a-44fd-951e-2aa19ec74458">here</a> for more information.</p>
<p class="cmln__paragraph"><strong class="cmln__strong">D. Marketing opt-outs</strong></p>

Users may also opt out of receiving emails and other messages from Uber by following the unsubscribe instructions in those messages. We may still send users who have opted out non-promotional communications, such as receipts for rides or information about their account.</p>
<p class="cmln__paragraph"><strong class="cmln__strong">E. User data requests</strong></p>
