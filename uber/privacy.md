This may include their name, email, phone number, login name and password, address, profile picture, payment or banking information (including related payment verification information), government identification documents, including driver’s license numbers and images, birthdate, signature, and photo. This also includes vehicle or insurance information of drivers and delivery partners, and user settings. We may use the photos submitted by drivers and/or delivery partners to verify their identities, such as through facial recognition technologies. For more information, please see the section titled “How we use personal data.”- Background check and identity verification: We collect background check and identity verification information for drivers and delivery partners. This may include information such as driver history or criminal record (where permitted by law), and right to work. This information may be collected by an authorized vendor on Uber’s behalf.

For drivers and delivery partners, Uber also retains vehicle and background check information (to the extent permitted by law) for as long as they maintain their Uber account.Riders and delivery recipients may request deletion of their account at any time through the Settings &gt; Privacy menus in the Uber app, or through Uber’s [Help Center](https://help.uber.com/h/55ae2bb5-b102-4ab0-9ed3-32f4db95f0e5). Following such requests, Uber deletes the data that it is not required to retain for purposes of regulatory, tax, insurance, litigation, or other legal requirements. For example, Uber retains location, device, and usage data for these purposes for a minimum of 7 years; while it retains such data, it may also use it for purposes of safety, security, fraud prevention and detection, and research and development.

|<h3><a id="_usf7eht5bgut"></a>**F. Grounds for processing**</h3>**We only collect and use personal data where we have lawful grounds to do so. These include processing user personal data to provide requested services and features, for purposes of Uber’s legitimate interests or those of other parties, to fulfill our legal obligations, or based on consent.**
|We collect and use personal data only where we have one or more lawful grounds for doing so. Such grounds may vary depending on where our users are located, but generally include processing personal data:a. To provide requested services and featuresIn order to provide our services, we must collect and use certain personal data. This includes:- User profile data, which we use to establish and maintain user accounts; verify user identity; communicate with users about their trips, orders, and accounts; and enable users to make payments or receive earnings- Background trip information, which is used to verify an applicant’s eligibility to be a driver or delivery partner- Driver and delivery partner location data, which we use to track trips and assist with navigation- Usage data, which is necessary to maintain, optimize, and enhance Uber’s services, including to determine incentives, connect riders and drivers, and calculate costs of trips and driver earnings- Transaction information- Information relating to customer supportb. For purposes of the legitimate interests of Uber or other partiesThis includes using personal data to maintain and enhance our users’ safety and security. For example, we use personal data to prevent use of our services by users who have engaged in inappropriate or dangerous behavior, such as by retaining data of banned users to prevent their use of Uber’s apps. We also use usage data to prevent matching of riders and drivers for whom there is higher risk of conflict (for instance, because they have been the subject of prior complaints from other users).This also includes purposes such as combating fraud; improving our services, direct marketing, research, and development; and enforcing Uber’s Terms of Service.In addition, it includes using personal data to the extent necessary for the interests of other people or the general public, such as in connection with legal or insurance claims, and to protect the rights and safety of others.c. To fulfill Uber’s legal obligationsFor example, Uber is subject to laws and regulations in many cities and countries that require it to collect and retain data about our users’ trips, and to provide copies of such data to the government or other authorities. We collect and use personal data to comply with such laws.Uber may also share data with law enforcement regarding criminal acts or threats to public safety, or requests by third parties pursuant to legal processes.

Responses to such surveys are collected on the basis of consent and will be deleted once no longer necessary for the purposes collected.A user who has provided consent to a collection or use of their personal data can revoke it at any time. However, the user will not be able to use any service or feature that requires collection or use of that personal data.

Android devices notify users of the permissions that the Uber app seeks before their first use of the app, and use of the app constitutes a grant of such permission.C. Ratings look-upAfter every trip, drivers and riders are able to rate each other on a scale from 1 to 5. An average of those ratings is associated with a user’s account and is displayed to other users for whom they provide or receive services. For example, rider ratings are available to drivers from whom they request transportation, and driver ratings are available to their riders.This 2-way system holds everyone accountable for their behavior. Accountability helps create a respectful, safe environment for drivers and riders. Riders can see their average rating in the main menu of the Uber app. Drivers can see their average rating after tapping their profile photo in the Uber Driver app.Delivery partners are also rated by delivery recipients and restaurant partners.
