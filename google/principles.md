# Our privacy and security <br/>principles.

We build privacy that works for everyone. Protecting our usersâ privacy and security is a responsibility that comes with creating products and services that are free and accessible for all. This is especially important as technology progresses and safety needs evolve. We look to these principles to guide our products, our processes, and our people in keeping our usersâ data private, safe, and secure.

### Respect our users.<br> â¨Respect their privacy.</br>

We believe these ideas are inseparable. Together, they represent a single, core belief that has influenced everything weâve made since day one, and everything weâll make moving forward. When people use our products, they trust us with their information, and itâs our job to do right by them. This means always being thoughtful about what data we use, how we use it, and how we protect it.

### Be clear about what <br/>data we collect <br/>and why.

To help people make informed decisions about how they use Google products, we make it easy to understand what data we collect, how itâs used, and why. Being transparent means making this information readily available, understandable, and actionable.

### Never sell our usersâ <br/> personal information<br/>to anyone.

We use data to make Google products like Search and Maps as useful as possible. We also use data to serve more relevant ads. While these ads help fund our services and make them free for everyone, itâs important to clarify that our usersâ personal  information is simply not for sale.

### Make it easy for <br/>people to control<br/> their privacy.

When it comes to privacy, we know one size doesnât fit all. Every Google Account is built with on/off data controls, so our users  can choose the privacy settings that are right for them. And as technology evolves, our privacy controls evolve as well, ensuring  that privacy is always an individual choice that belongs to the user.

### Empower people<br/> to review, move,<br/> or delete their data.

We believe every user should have access to the personal  information theyâve shared with us â anytime and for any reason. Thatâs why we continue to make it easier for people to access  and review their data, download and move it to another service if  they want, or delete it entirely.

### Build the strongest<br/> security technologies<br/> into our products.

Respecting the privacy of our users means protecting the data  they trust us with. To keep every Google product and service  secure for our users, we engineer and employ one of the most advanced security infrastructures in the world. This means  constantly strengthening our built-in security technologies to  detect and protect against evolving online threats, before they  ever reach our users.

### Lead by example<br/> to advance online<br/> security for all.

Keeping users safe online doesnât stop with Google â it extends to the whole internet. Google was the first company to create many  of the security standards we all use today, and we continue to innovate new security technologies that can be used by everyone.  We share our security learnings, experiences, and tools with  partners, organizations, and competitors around the world,  because internet-wide security demands industry-wide collaboration.
