      We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google

       services

      , and what we expect from you.
     </h3>
     <p>
      These Terms of Service reflect
      <a class="N6CPUe" href="https://about.google/intl/en_US/how-our-business-works" target="_blank">
       the way Google’s business works

       certain things we’ve always believed to be true
      </a>
      . As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:

       <a href="terms#toc-what-you-expect">

     <p>
      Understanding these terms is important because, by using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms.

      Besides these terms, we also publish a

      About these terms
     </h1>
     <p>
      By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.
     </p>
     <p>
      These terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any legal rights for other people or
      <a class="UADm2d" data-name="organization" href="terms#footnote-organization" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">
       organizations
      </a>
      , even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.
     </p>
     <p>
      We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our
      <a class="UADm2d" data-name="services" href="terms#footnote-services" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">
       services
      </a>
      . But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.
     </p>
     <p>
      If these terms conflict with the
      <a href="terms/service-specific">
       service-specific additional terms
      </a>
      , the additional terms will govern for that service.
     </p>
     <p>
      If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you don’t follow these terms or the
      <a href="terms/service-specific">
       service-specific additional terms
      </a>
      , and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.
     </p>
     <p>
      We may update these terms and
      <a href="terms/service-specific">
       service-specific additional terms
      </a>
      (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.
     </p>
     <p>
      If we materially change these terms or
      <a href="terms/service-specific">
       service-specific additional terms
      </a>
      , we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove
      <a class="UADm2d" data-name="your-content" href="terms#footnote-your-content" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">
       your content
      </a>
      and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Google Account.
