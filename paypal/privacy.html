Reading it will help you understand your privacy rights and choices. </a></p> <p>&ldquo;Personal data&rdquo; in this statement means information about you, including your identity, finances, and online behavior.</p> <p>&ldquo;PayPal&rdquo; in this statement means PayPal, Inc. This privacy statement only applies to the PayPal and Xoom services offered by PayPal. To learn about our privacy practices for our other products or services, like Venmo or Braintree, visit the website and review the privacy statement for that product or service.</p> <h3><a name=\"privacyRights\"></a>Your privacy rights and choices</h3> <p>When it comes to how your personal data is collected, stored, used, and shared, you have rights and choices.</p> <h4 style=\"padding-top: 15px;\"><strong><a name=\"understandingRights\"></a>Understanding your rights</strong></h4> <p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we&rsquo;ve collected about you in the past 12 months. You also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you. If you want to see or delete your personal data, <a href=\"#contactUs\">contact us</a>. We will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.</p> <p>If you request to see or delete your personal data, we&rsquo;ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request. If we can&rsquo;t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.</p> <p>If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:</p> <ul style=\"margin-left: 25px; margin-top: 0px\"> <li>Log in to your account and delete information you previously added. For example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings</li> <li>Call us and request that we delete specific information</li> <li>Close your account</li> </ul> <p>If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:</p> <ul style=\"margin-left: 25px; margin-top: 0px\"> <li>Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement or other contract you have with us</li> <li>Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity</li> <li>Protect your (or another person&rsquo;s) legal rights, including the right to free speech</li> <li>Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services </li> <li>Comply with laws</li> </ul> <p>Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data. For example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Consumers may read our <a href=\"#consumerPrivacy\"><u>Consumer Privacy Notice</u></a> for more information about their rights under US federal law.</p> <h4><strong><a name=\"understandingChoices\"></a>Understanding your choices</strong></h4> <p>You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you. Here are some of the ways you can customize your choices.</p> <p><strong>Choose how we collect personal data</strong></p> <p>You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it. To help make choices that are right for you, it&rsquo;s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you. Also, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.</p> <p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to. If you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts. Another example is creating an account with us. If you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.</p> <p><strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data</strong></p> <p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them. Read the third parties&rsquo; privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.</p> <p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you. For example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.</p> <p><strong>Choose how we communicate with you</strong></p> <p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered. Some messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us. We use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.</p> <p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying &ldquo;STOP,&rdquo; or turn off notifications on your device. You can also change your account&rsquo;s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.</p> <p>You won&rsquo;t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account&rsquo;s status that require your attention. You may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device. </p> <h3><a name=\"dataCollect\"></a>The personal data we collect</h3> <p>We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant&rsquo;s website.</p> <p>If you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we&rsquo;ll still collect personal data, which may include your payment information, device information, and location. When you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we will use this information to process transactions, prevent fraud and comply with the law. We may connect this information with your account, if you have one or if you create an account at a later date. </p> <p>Here are the kinds of personal data that we may collect when you create an account or use our services:</p> <p>1.

Commercial information, for example:</p> <ul style=\"margin-left: 25px; \"> <li>Online shopping cart information</li> <li>Purchase history</li> </ul> <p>5. Internet or network activity, for example:</p> <ul style=\"margin-left: 25px; \"> <li>Interactions with our services or sites</li> <li>Shopping history</li> </ul> <p>6.

We&rsquo;ll delete it immediately, unless we&rsquo;re legally required to keep it.</p> <h4><strong><a id=\"cookies\" name=\"cookies\" class=\"anchor\"></a>How we use tracking technologies like cookies</strong></h4> <p>We or our authorized service providers may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect personal data whenever you use our services, visit our sites, or visit websites that offer our services. The information collected with these technologies helps us personalize your experience, measure the effect of our ads, prevent fraud and enhance the security of our sites and service.</p> <p>You can disable or decline some cookies for our sites and services. But, since some parts of our service rely on cookies to work, those services could become difficult or impossible to use.</p> <p>Some web browsers have an optional setting called &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; (DNT) that lets you opt-out of being tracked by advertisers and some third parties. Because many of our services won&rsquo;t function without tracking data, we do not respond to DNT settings.</p> <p>If you want to know more about how we use cookies, read our <a href=\"/webapps/mpp/ua/cookie-full\"><u>Cookie Statement</u></a>. To learn how to opt-out of this kind of tracking technology, visit <a href=\"https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&amp;lang=EN\"><u>About Ads</u></a>.</p> <h3><a name=\"collectData\"></a>Why we collect personal data</h3> <p>We collect personal data for many reasons, including to improve your experience, and to run our business. Specific reasons why we collect your personal data include:</p> <ol style=\"margin-left: 25px\"> <li>Run our sites and provide better services, for example to help you send or request money, make purchases, show you your account information, verify access to your account, and keep your account and payment information up to date.</li> <li value=\"2\">Manage and improve our business.

This privacy statement only applies to the PayPal and Xoom services offered by PayPal. To learn about our privacy practices for our other products or services, like Venmo or Braintree, visit the website and review the privacy statement for that product or service.</p> <h3><a name="privacyRights"></a>Your privacy rights and choices</h3> <p>When it comes to how your personal data is collected, stored, used, and shared, you have rights and choices.</p> <h4 style="padding-top:15px"><strong><a name="understandingRights"></a>Understanding your rights</strong></h4> <p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months. You also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you. If you want to see or delete your personal data, <a href="#contactUs">contact us</a>. We will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.</p> <p>If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request. If we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.</p> <p>If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:</p> <ul style="margin-left:25px;margin-top:0px"> <li>Log in to your account and delete information you previously added. For example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings</li> <li>Call us and request that we delete specific information</li> <li>Close your account</li> </ul> <p>If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:</p> <ul style="margin-left:25px;margin-top:0px"> <li>Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement or other contract you have with us</li> <li>Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity</li> <li>Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech</li> <li>Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services </li> <li>Comply with laws</li> </ul> <p>Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data. For example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Consumers may read our <a href="#consumerPrivacy"><u>Consumer Privacy Notice</u></a> for more information about their rights under US federal law.</p> <h4><strong><a name="understandingChoices"></a>Understanding your choices</strong></h4> <p>You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you. Here are some of the ways you can customize your choices.</p> <p><strong>Choose how we collect personal data</strong></p> <p>You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it. To help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you. Also, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.</p> <p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to. If you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts. Another example is creating an account with us. If you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.</p> <p><strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data</strong></p> <p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them. Read the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.</p> <p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you. For example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.</p> <p><strong>Choose how we communicate with you</strong></p> <p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered. Some messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us. We use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.</p> <p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device. You can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.</p> <p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention. You may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device. </p> <h3><a name="dataCollect"></a>The personal data we collect</h3> <p>We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant’s website.</p> <p>If you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we’ll still collect personal data, which may include your payment information, device information, and location. When you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we will use this information to process transactions, prevent fraud and comply with the law.

The information collected with these technologies helps us personalize your experience, measure the effect of our ads, prevent fraud and enhance the security of our sites and service.</p> <p>You can disable or decline some cookies for our sites and services.
