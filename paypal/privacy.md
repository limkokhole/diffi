### <a id="05" name="05" pa-marked="1"></a>V.  Do We Share Personal Data?**  **

We may share your Personal Data or other information about you with others in a variety of ways as described in this section of the Privacy Statement. In addition, our Consumer Privacy Notice provides specific information about the reasons why we share the Personal Data of certain United States residents with unaffiliated third parties.

We may share your Personal Data or other information for the following reasons:

**With other members of the PayPal corporate family:** We may share your Personal Data with members of the PayPal family of entities to, among other things, provide the Services you have requested or authorized; to manage risk; to help detect and prevent potentially illegal and fraudulent acts and other violations of our policies and agreements; and to help us manage the availability and connectivity of PayPal products, Services, and communications.

**With other companies that provide services to us: **We may share Personal Data with third-party service providers that perform services and functions at our direction and on our behalf.  These third-party service providers may, for example, provide you with Services, verify your identity, assist in processing transactions, send you advertisements for our products and Services, or provide customer support. 

**With other financial institutions: **We may share Personal Data with other financial institutions that we have partnered with to jointly create and offer a product, such as with Synchrony Bank in connection with the PayPal Extras credit card.  These financial institutions may only use this information to market and offer PayPal-related products, unless you have given consent for other uses. We may also share Personal Data to process transactions, provide you with benefits associated with your eligible cards, and keep your financial information up to date.

**With the other parties to transactions when you use the Services, such as other Users, merchants, and their service providers: **We may share information about you and your Account with the other parties involved in processing your transactions. This includes other Users you are sending or receiving funds from, and merchants and their service providers. The information might include:
 - Personal Data and Account Information necessary to facilitate the transaction; - information to help other participant(s) resolve disputes and detect and prevent fraud; and - aggregated data and performance analytics to help merchants better understand Users and to help merchants enhance Users’ experiences.  
**With other third parties for our business purposes or as permitted or required by law: **We may share information about you with other parties for PayPal’s business purposes or as permitted or required by law, including:
 - if we need to do so to comply with a law, legal process or regulations; - to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or other third parties pursuant to a subpoena, a court order or other legal process or requirement applicable to PayPal or PayPal’s corporate family; - if we believe, in our sole discretion, that the disclosure of Personal Data is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity;  - to protect the vital interests of a person; - to investigate violations of or enforce a user agreement or other legal terms applicable to any Service; - to protect our property, Services and legal rights; - to facilitate a purchase or sale of all or part of PayPal’s business; - in connection with shipping and related services for purchases made using a Service; - to help assess and manage risk and prevent fraud against us, our Users and fraud involving our Sites or use of our Services, including fraud that occurs at or involves our business partners, strategic ventures, or other individuals and merchants, such as eBay, Inc.; - to banking partners as required by card association rules for inclusion on their list of terminated merchants;  - to credit reporting and collection agencies; - to companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by; and - to support our audit, compliance, and corporate governance functions. 
**With your consent: **We also will share your Personal Data and other information with your consent or direction, including if you authorize an account connection with a third-party account or platform. 

In addition, PayPal may provide aggregated statistical data to third-parties, including other businesses and members of the public, about how, when, and why Users visit our Sites and use our Services.  This data will not personally identify you or provide information about your use of the Sites or Services.  We do not share your Personal Data with third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent.<br/>  

[Back to top](#top)

### <a id="06" name="06" pa-marked="1"></a>VI.  How Do We Work with Other Services and Platforms? 

A significant benefit and innovation of PayPal’s Services is that you can connect your Account with a third-party account or platform.  For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, an “account connection” with such a third-party is a connection you authorize or enable between your Account and a non-PayPal account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own.  When you authorize such a connection, PayPal and the third-party will exchange your Personal Data and other information directly.  Examples of account connections include:
 - linking your Account to a social media account or social messaging service; - connecting your Account to a third-party data aggregation or financial services company, if you provide such company with your Account log-in credentials; or - using your Account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your Account. 
If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third-party about you and your use of the third-party’s service.  For example, if you connect your Account to a social media account, we will receive Personal Data from the social media provider via the account connection.  If you connect your Account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party service provider, we may have access to your account balance and transactional information, such as purchases and funds transfers.  We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement. 

Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party’s privacy practices.  Before authorizing an account connection, you should review the privacy notice of any third-party that will gain access to your Personal Data as part of the account connection.  For example, Personal Data that PayPal shares with a third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be shared with certain other parties, including the general public, depending on the account’s or platform’s privacy practices.

## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

This privacy statement explains how and why PayPal collects, stores, uses, and shares personal data when you visit our websites or use our services. Reading it will help you understand your privacy rights and choices. 

“Personal data” in this statement means information about you, including your identity, finances, and online behavior.

“PayPal” in this statement means PayPal, Inc.  This privacy statement only applies to the PayPal and Xoom services offered by PayPal. To learn about our privacy practices for our other products or services, like Venmo or Braintree, visit the website and review the privacy statement for that product or service.

 

## <a name="privacyRights"></a>Your privacy rights and choices

When it comes to how your personal data is collected, stored, used, and shared, you have rights and choices. 

### <a name="understandingRights"></a>Understanding your rights

You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months. You also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you. If you want to see or delete your personal data, [contact us](#contactUs) . We will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.

If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request. If we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.

If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:  
 - Log in to your account and delete information you previously added. For example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings - Call us and request that we delete specific information - Close your account 
If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:
 - Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement or other contract you have with us - Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity - Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech - Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services - Comply with laws 
Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data. For example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.  Consumers may read our [<u>Consumer Privacy Notice</u> ](#consumerPrivacy) for more information about their rights under US federal law. 

 

### <a name="understandingChoices"></a>Understanding your choices

You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you. Here are some of the ways you can customize your choices.

**Choose how we collect personal data**

You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it

To help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you.  Also, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.

For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to. If you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.

Another example is creating an account with us. If you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.

**Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data**

If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them. Read the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.

You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you. For example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.

**Choose how we communicate with you**

Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered. Some messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us. We use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.

You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device. You can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.

You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention. You may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.

 

## <a name="dataCollect"></a>The personal data we collect

We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant’s website.

If you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we’ll still collect personal data, which may include your payment information, device information, and location. When you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we will use this information to process transactions, prevent fraud and comply with the law. We may connect this information with your account, if you have one.

[<u>Contact us</u> ](#contactUs) if you believe that we’ve mistakenly collected personal data from someone not allowed to use our services. We’ll delete it immediately, unless we’re legally required to keep it.

### <a name="cookies"></a>How we use tracking technologies like cookies

We or our authorized service providers may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect personal data whenever you use our services, visit our sites, or visit websites that offer our services. The information collected with these technologies helps us personalize your experience, measure the effect of our ads, prevent fraud and enhance the security of our sites and service.

You can disable or decline some cookies for our sites and services. But, since some parts of our service rely on cookies to work, those services could become difficult or impossible to use.

Some web browsers have an optional setting called “Do Not Track” (DNT) that lets you opt-out of being tracked by advertisers and some third parties. Because many of our services won’t function without tracking data, we do not respond to DNT settings.

If you want to know more about how we use cookies, read our [<u>Cookie Statement</u>](#cookies) . To learn how to opt-out of this kind of tracking technology, visit [<u>About Ads</u>](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&amp;lang=EN) .
